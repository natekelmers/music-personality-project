Mondays were made to fall  Lost on a road he knew by heart  It was like a book he read in his sleep, endlessly  Sometimes he hid in his radio  Watching others pull into their homes  While he was drifting  On a line  Of his own  Off the line  Off the side  By the by  As dirt turned to sand  As if moved by sleight of hand  When he reached the shore of his clip-on world  He resurfaced to the norm  Organized his few things, his coat and keys  Any new realizations would have to wait  Till he had more time  More time  A time to dream  To himself  He waves goodbye  To himself  I'll see you on the other side  Another man moved by sleight of hand",,

Finally they're opening up the gates! There'll be actual real live people It'll be totally strange But wow! Am I so ready for this change 'Cause for the first time in forever There'll be music, there'll be light! For the first time in forever I'll be dancing through the night Don't know if I'm elated or gassy But I'm somewhere in that zone! 'Cause for the first time in forever I won't be alone I can't wait to meet everyone! What if I meet. The one? Tonight, imagine me gown and all Fetchingly draped against the wall The picture of sophisticated grace Ooh! I suddenly see him standing there A beautiful stranger, tall and fair I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face! But then we laugh and talk all evening Which is totally bizarre Nothing like the life I've lead so far! For the first time in forever There'll be magic, there'll be fun! For the first time in forever I could be noticed by someone And I know it is totally crazy To dream I'd find romance But for the first time in forever At least I've got a chance! Don't let them in Don't let them see Be the good girl You always have to be Conceal Don't feel Put on a show Make one wrong move And everyone will know But it's only for today It's only for today! It's agony to wait It's agony to wait! Tell the guards to open up the gate! The gate! For the first time in forever Don't let them in, don't let them see I'm getting what I'm dreaming of! Be the good girl you always have to be A chance to change my lonely world Conceal A chance to find true love! Conceal, don't feel Don't let them know I know it all ends tomorrow So it has to be today! 'Cause for the first time in forever For the first time in forever Nothing's in my way!",,,,

But now it seems your baggage Is the only thing than you can bring You had a lie for everything And now your world is crumbling (Ah ooh) So now you find you're on your own You find you're on your own Trying to find your way back home Trying to find your way back You used to talk to God But you gave up 'cause you couldn't see Couldn't get from A to be	 But were you ever really listening Enough's enough you know But then you never really had enough Something more to fill you up Maybe just a smaller cup (Ah ooh) So now you find you're on your own You find you're on your own (Ah ooh) Trying to find your way back home Trying to find your way back home You used to think that You would never be alone But you're losing control You find it hard to see at all To find your way back There used to be a time When you divided Everything you had You had a lie for everything Or were you ever really listening? You used to talk to God But you gave up But then you really never had enough Or have you lost your memory? Memory But now you find you're on your own To find your way back home,,,,

When that feeling of meaninglessness sets in,  Go blowing my mind on God:  The light in the dark, with the neon arms,  The meek He seeks, the beast He calms,  The head of the good soul department.  I see myself suddenly  On the piano, as a melody.  My terrible fear of dying  No longer plays with me,  for now I know that I&#039;m needed  For the symphony.  I associate love with red,  The colour of my heart when she&#039;s dead;  Red in my mind when the jealousy flies,  Red in my eyes from emotional ties,  Manipulation, the danger signs.  The more I think about sex, the better it gets.  Here we have a purpose in life:  Good for the blood circulation,  Good for releasing the tension,  The root of our reincarnations.

It was later than I thought when I first believed you, Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

I won't leave you drifting down, but woh it makes me wild, With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child. Ship of fools on a cruel sea, ship of fools sail away from me. It was later than I thought when I first believed you, Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools. The bottles stand as empty, as they were filled before. Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more. Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few: Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun Took a shot of cocaine and away I run Made a good run but I run too slow They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico. Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down. I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee If you've got a warrant just read it to me Shot her down cause she made me slow I thought I was her daddy but she had five more. When I was arrested I was dressed in black They put me on a train and they took me back Had no friends for to go my bail They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail. Early next morning about a half past nine I spied a sheriff comin' down the line Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat He said come on you dirty hack into that district court Into the court room my trial began Where I was handled by twelve honest men Just before the jury started out I saw that little judge commence to look about. In about five minutes in walked a man Holding the verdict in his right hand The verdict read in the first degree I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen Ninety nine years underneath that ground I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down Come on you gotta listen unto me Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be,,,,

We started singin' Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye And singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die They were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die",,,,

Shadows on the hills Sketch the trees and the daffodils Catch the breeze and the winter chills In colors on the snowy linen land. And now I understand what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free. They would not listen They did not know how Perhaps they'll listen now. Starry Starry night Flaming flo'rs that brightly blaze Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue. Colors changing hue Morning fields of amber grain Weathered faces lined in pain Are soothed beneath the artist's Loving hand. And now I understand what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free. Perhaps they'll listen now. For they could not love you But still your love was true And when no hope was left in sight on that starry Starry night. You took your life As lovers often do; But I could have told you Vincent This world was never Meant for one As beautiful as you. Starry Starry night Portraits hung in empty halls Frameless heads on nameless walls With eyes That watch the world and can't forget. Like the stranger that you've met The ragged men in ragged clothes The silver thorn of bloody rose Lie crushed and broken On the virgin snow. And now I think I know what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free. They would not listen They're not List'ning still Perhaps they never will.,,,,

Into the vision of some vacant mind. Oh once I held a pony by its flying mane, And once I called the shadow in the turning game But I will fight this stranger that you should fear So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear Aw Xavier's on the border of the sun Swings on the chambers of your guns. And tries to shoot the chord and light the path. Aw but hell I'm just a blind man on the plains, I drink my water when it rains, And live by chance among the lightning strikes. Oh once I held a glacier to an open flame And once I felt like wildcat in the fallen game. But I will fight this stranger that you should fear So I won't be a burden of tomorrow dear.

2488,"She’s sticking needles in her skin I turn with an ugly grin Her canvas doesn’t leave a lot to fantasy But her peace of mind can’t stay inside the lines It’s so confusing, the methods that she’s using She knows she shouldn’t leave a mark that I can see Will she ever find one million of a kind? It’s cold and lonely, but that’s because she told me Lost inside her dirty world, No one hurts this pretty girl but her Oh, she’s beautiful A little better than a man deserves Oh, I’m not insane Please tell me she won’t change Maybe I should let her go But only when she loves me How can I just let her go Not until she loves me  She’s drowning in herself again My God, what a lovely sin I guess there’s nothing left to do, but have my way She can feel it’s right so she doesn’t close her eyes She smiles and answers it doesn’t seem to matter Lost inside my dirty head, something tells me I’m the one who’s kept Oh, so volatile A little better than a man defiled Oh, I need the pain Please tell me she won’t change Maybe I should let her go But only when she loves me How can I just let her go Not until she loves me  We were meant to be together Now die and fucking love me We were meant to hurt each other Now die and fucking love me Die and fucking love me Die and fucking love me Die and fucking love me",,,,
2489,"So you face it with a smile There is no need to cry For a trifle's more than this Will you still recall my name And the month it all began Will you release me with a kiss Have I tried to draw the veil If I have, how could I fail Did I fear the consequence Dazed by careless words Cozy in my mind I don't mind I think so I will let you go Now you shaped that liquid wax Fit it out with crater cracks Sweet devotion my delight Oh, you're such a pretty one And the naked thrills of flesh and skin Would tease me through the night ""Now I hate to leave you bare If you need me I'll be there Don't you ever let me down"" Dazed by careless words Cozy in my mind I don't mind I think so I will let you go And I touched your face Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane And I called your name Like an addicted to cocaine calls for the stuff he'd rather blame And I touched your face Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane And I called your name My cocaine I don't mind I think so I will let you go",,,,

2491,"I'm gonna fight 'em all A seven nation army couldn't hold me back They're gonna rip it off Taking their time right behind my back And I'm talking to myself at night Because I can't forget Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigarette And the message coming from my eyes Says leave it alone Don't want to hear about it Every single one's got a story to tell Everyone knows about it From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell And if I catch it coming back my way I'm gonna serve it to you And that ain't what you want to hear But that's what I'll do And the feeling coming from my bones Says find a home I'm going to Wichita Far from this opera for evermore I'm gonna work the straw Make the sweat drip out of every pore And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding Right before the lord All the words are gonna bleed from me And I will sing no more And the stains coming from my blood Tell me go back home",,,,
