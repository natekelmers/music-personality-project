There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out And we can try out the four-wheel drive Come on now what do you say Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires. 'Cause it's a good night To be out there soakin' up the moonlight Stake out a little piece of shore line I've got the perfect place in mind. It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there You got to get a little mud on the tires. Moonlight on a duck blind Catfish on a trot line Sun sets about nine this time of year We can throw a blanket down Crickets singin' in the background And more stars that you can count on a night this clear. I tell you what we need to do Is grab a sleepin' bag or two And build us a little campfire And then with a little luck we might just get stuck Let's get a little mud on the tires.

364,When I grow up I want to be a forester Run through the moss on high heels That's what I'll do Throwing out boomerang Waiting for it to come back to me When I grow up I want to live near the sea Crab claws and bottles of rum That's what I'll have Staring at the seashell Waiting for it to embrace me I put my soul in what I do Last night I drew a funny man With dark eyes and a hanging tongue It goes way bad I never liked a sad look From someone who wants to be loved by you I'm very good with plants When my friends are away They let me keep the soil moist On the seventh day I rest For a minute or two Then back on my feet and cry for you You've got cucumbers on your eyes Too much time spent on nothing Waiting for a moment to arise The face in the ceiling And arms too long I wait for him to catch me Waiting for you to embrace me,,,

Child, you know how much I need it. Too young to hold on And too old to just break free and run Sometimes a man gets carried away, When he feels like he should be having his fun Much too blind to see the damage he's done Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really, He has no one So I'll wait for you and I'll burn Will I ever see your sweet return, Or, will I ever learn? Lover, you should've come over 'Cause it's not too late. Lonely is the room the bed is made The open window lets the rain in Burning in the corner is the only one Who dreams he had you with him My body turns and yearns for a sleep That won't ever come It's never over, My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder It's never over, all my riches for her smiles When I slept so soft against her It's never over, All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter It's never over, She is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever But maybe I'm just too young, To keep good love from going wrong Oh lover, you should've come over, yeah yeah yes I feel too young to hold on I'm much too old to break free and run Too deaf, dumb, and blind To see the damage I've done Sweet lover, you should've come over Oh, love I've waited for you Lover, you should've come over 'Cause it's not too late",,,
