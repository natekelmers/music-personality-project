78,"I've hardly been outside my room in days 'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away And it was then I realize the conscience never fades When you're young you have this image of your life That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross And if you happen to you wake completely lost But I will fight for you, be sure that I will fight Until we're the special two once again And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together Our hands would not be taught to hold another's 'Cause we're the special two And we can only see each other, we'll breathe together These arms will not be taught to need another's 'Cause we're the special two I remember someone old once said to me That lies will lock you up with truth the only key I was comfortable and warm inside my shell And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face? Well, my guess the answer is don't do it in the first place I know, I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now But if by chance you change your mind You know I will not let you down 'Cause we were the special two and will be again And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together Our hands would not be taught to hold another's 'Cause we're the special two And we can only see each other, we'll breathe together These arms will not be taught to need another's We're the special two I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease Or something that could ease the pain But nothing cures the hurt, you, you bring on boy yourself Just remembering, just remembering how we were And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together These hands would not be taught to hold another's We were the special two And we could only see each other, we'd bleed together These arms would not be taught to need another's 'Cause we're the special two",,

84,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black, Why you never see bright colors on my back, And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone. Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on. I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who never read, Or listened to the words that Jesus said, About the road to happiness through love and charity, Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old, For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold, I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been, Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. And, I wear it for the thousands who have died, Believen' that the Lord was on their side, I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died, Believen' that we all were on their side. Well, there's things that never will be right I know, And things need changin' everywhere you go, But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right, You'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day, And tell the world that everything's OK, But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back, 'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black",,

She said, ""Downtown"" He had babies havin babies - and young niggaz sellin crack I think the bitch is lyin, it's a set up I can smell it, but Ignorance is runnin rampant Aight baby show me the exact spot Meet me at Hoyt and Schermerhorn at 3 on the dot So I hops up on the A-Train, I'm bein followed My seventh sense senses danger I turn around, it's Anger and he brought a mob along, it's the same old song Despair and Animosity got broke with the swiftness I don't know what they think this is I feel a sharp pain in my neck Now I can't see, I'm like Hiram They hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum I tried to hold on but before long I dropped When I awoke I was locked in the barber's shop Trapped in the barber's chair Oh no, they're gonna try and cut my hair But that can't stop the Prophet Yo Prophet! Ignorance is tired of you followin him around We about to put an end to that RIGHT NOW Anamosity (YEA!) Despair (YO WHASSUP?) Get him!! A few minutes passed by, I hear a buzzin noise It was that chick with some of Ignorance's boys She said, ""Prophet, we got you beat; by the way I'm Mr. Ignorance's wife, Deceit But enough talk; now for your hair cut"" When the clippers touched my hair, they blew the fuck up After the explosion there was no one left Cause I know Dim Mak/poison hand/touch of death My vision's still kinda blurry, but I see a clue Ignorance is at the library I hurry, with lightning speed like The Flash He's at the big one, on Grand, Army Plaz' When I get inside the doors shut and the lights go off Damn, another trap I hear a hissin sound, I smell a funny smell I gasp, I can't breathe Ignorance is laughin at me Waitin on my downfall, but he can't stop the Prophet",,

Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways Yeah, ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you For you For you For you",,
325,Two of us riding nowhere Spending someone's Hard earned pay Two of us Sunday driving Not arriving On our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home Two of us sending postcards Writing letters On my wall You and me burning matches Lifting latches On our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead Two of us wearing raincoats Standing so low In the sun You and me chasing paper Getting nowhere On our way back home We're on our way home We're on our way home We're going home,,
326,"Don't cry my love don't cry no more A crashing sky a rolling screen A city drowning Gods black tears I cannot bear to see She lay under the midnight moon Her restless body stirring Until the magic morning hour Like poison it succumbs her Her baby skin her old black dress Her hair it twists round her necklace Constricts and chokes like ruthless vines To sleep she overtakes her? Her room is painted Heron Blue Lit by candlelight and chandelier And from her headboard perched so high A million dreams have passed her Don't cry my love don't cry no more It overwhelms my breaking heart A minor swell of violins I cannot bear to hear them A mother shepherds her young birds She fills their mouths and warms their souls Till they are strong and good to fly Away from her alone she'll die Cradle on quiet old oak limbs As heaven blue her light fails A breath of soot into her lungs A life, a journeys end in one Don't sing that old sad hymn no more It resonates inside my soul It haunts me in my waking dream I cannot bear to hear it Don't play those violins no more Their melancholic overtones They echo off the floor and walls I cannot bear to hear them",,

I can't find mommy, where is she?"" ""I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"" I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing ""You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"" ""Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"" She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it ""Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, ""This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"" I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em They're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' ""Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"" But baby we're in Sweden How did you get to Sweden? ""I followed you daddy You told me that you weren't leavin' You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"" ""I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"" ""But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us That's what they want They want you, Marshall They keep screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!

I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones you've followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong?

596,"As I was walkin' down Grosvenor Square, Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air, From the other direction she was calling my eye, Could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try. She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes, And I knew without askin' she was into the blues. She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls, I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls. In the heat of the evening when the dealin' got rough, She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff. As I picked up my matches and was closin' the door, I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before. Well I ain't often right but I've never been wrong, Seldom turns out the way it does in the song. Once in a while you get shown the light In the strangest of places if you look at it right. Well there ain't nothin' wrong with the way she moves, All scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues. And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by. The wind in the willow's playing ""Tea for Two, "" The sky was yellow and the sun was blue, Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand, Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band.",,

Lord, when I saw him walkin' back in that bar, all tall and lean with them broad shoulders, sweet lips, I knew that I had died and gone to Chocolate Heaven He had a real deep voice, white pearly teeth, his shoe was always shiny. Long slender fingers manicured perfectly. The man wore 800-dollar Italian suit, straight from, I dunno, what would they call it, Milan or Rome or someplace like that? I knew it wasn't local.  I said, I got to get next to that. I haven't seen him in a long time.  The man was so fine, he could get any good girl into trouble Can you guess what his name was? Well 'The Jackal' 'The Jackal' Say.  'The Jackal'  He was fat back cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin' at a quarter after 5. Twist of lime, Coke on the side. The brother loved the high life.  Had a Ph.D. in street stride. They called him 'The Jackal'. He was big Mack daddy super black stylin' a diamonds in the back Cadillac. Fur-lined boards, white wall wheels, cruise control, built for speed, chrome on evray-thang. And stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them. When they called him 'The Jackal'. Say.  'The Jackal'. Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard, livin' fast, livin' large, 6 foot 4 and not an ounce of fat! When women asked, 'is you a Cat?' He said 'I did more that that. I'm the firmest of the firm And in case you, hadn't known, they call me 'The Jackal'. Served the 18-year bid First Reicker's Island then they hid him in the state penitentiary. Said the charge was Grand Larceny. That was 1975, and today, if he's still alive, he'd be living in the park. Hm. The brother whose claim to fame was that they called him 'The Jackal'.

The only way to find the power is to look inside Increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow Now you hold this secret, appeared out of the vacuum of space Remain in what you are, the center of your life You made it to this point, no one can tell you how You crawled and bled all the way but you were the only one That was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself",,

688,"Sleep as the goer The bridge that watches the light speed through And cries while the spirit stumbles The inside missile for the protection of you Maybe it's silent The voice can't bear anymore strain But speaks without even knowing And streams outside in the direction of truth There's no reason there's no secrets to decode If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road Wide open arms can feel so cold So cold Feel so cold Balance the books, the ledges, the loons The disappointed look on the faces That squint at the moon Let's see it with shadows enhanced And then vote to decide who'll advance Silver jet plane, making a turn Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed If you're conscious you must be depressed Or at least cynical But someone might still eat the steaks Even if they're tough Spending the day Chewing the fat Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough Oh Marianne, pass me the joint The sandpaper's tan Go-getters are surfing the point And London's a scratch on the lens It's over before it begins Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick But really there's no trip at all That doesn't result in a fall Or a faltering But something could spit out the bait Even if it's real Rolling away Missing a spoke Close to the ground like a wheel but it's not a joke Holding the line Clutching the phone Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right It's not right Smelling for blood Praying for rain Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough The low tide is telling me, when it's over, To breathe in everything exposed And comes back to cover me with a blanket Being here's always changing tunes The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all Wide open arms can feel so cold And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's Worth But I hope I die before I get sold I hope I die before I get sold I'd rather die before I get sold If you find the soul that you lost Frozen in a starry void Take it within and hope the sight of blood Can will signs of life to return Back to the way that it was Long before it made a noise To keep on quietly reminding you What's never created or destroyed Wake as the swell peaks The close-outs drowning the birds with roars And howls scare the new unkindness That picks and laughs at the carrion scene Forces you see breath can always go into hiding And wait 'til it passes over Or stay far gone for all eternity",,

A shot in the dark, always creeping up on you Taught by the powers that preach over me I can hear their empty reason I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight I opened up my mind to treason But just like the wounded and when it's too late They'll remember they'll surrender Never a care for the people who hate Underestimate me now But a shot in the dark one step away from you A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do A shot in the dark always creeping up on you But just like the wounded and when it's too late They'll remember they'll surrender Never a care for the people who hate Underestimate me now But a shot in the dark one step away from you A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do A shot in the dark always creeping up on you",,
964,"First off let me say you look so tired  Rest your head and shut your eyes  Empty ambition blankets the sky  I'm thinking 'bout another world tonight  So drop the gown the game's over  Just push your face into the fight  And it breaks my heart like dancing up all night Ride so high we both start thinking  'Bout another world tonight  And it feels so wrong  Like nothing we've ever felt before  The stranger's candy takes you where  You ought to be  In broken alleys  In the back of every street  Close your eyes tonight, baby  You can have it, ooh baby  Gnaw me down to the bone  Soon you'll find I'm never  Gonna take you back home  Well there's so much you never told me  And there's not much I want to know  Cause your pretty face will do just fine  You'll be the star of my every last show  Let's go for a long ride  I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave The stranger's candy takes you where  You ought to be  In broken alleys  In the back of every street  Tonight we could bring it all down  We could bring it all down  They think this body's a dead note  Dancing to the beat but they'll never see  This corpse coming 'til it kills them",,

966,"When the rain is blowing in your face And the whole world is on your case I could offer you a warm embrace To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears Oh, I hold you for a million years To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I will never do you wrong I've known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue And I'd go crawling down the avenue No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret The winds of change are blowing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true There's nothing that I wouldn't do Go to the ends of this Earth for you To make you feel my love, oh yes To make you feel my love",,
967,And I received an education all the while I've come to an understanding When you say you love me sometimes That's all you can give Love might just be an economy But I don't believe in property We don't own nothin' We don't owe nothin' And you wondered why I was so terrified The night of our proclamation Now do you understand The risk we'd undertaken Was a deer runnin' free Til it's last breath found your window We killed and drove on indecently Oh how you screamed But I'll never change You'll never change,,
