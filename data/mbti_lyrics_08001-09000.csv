Are you mad at your walls Or hoping that an unknown force can repair things for you? Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale grey garden? If the ship will never come you've got to move along Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start The falling apart Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder The waves of black If she's going under I can hold my breath till the sky comes back Or drown like a rat, rat, rat He's a rat! To catch a monster We make a movie Set the tempo And cut and cut its brains out It will inspire on the burning pyre Half the distance Half the motion Communication It's easy as the ocean",,,,

Was ich sah ließ mich nicht mehr los,  Zu entdecken ihr Geheimnis,  War die Nacht für mich verloren. Tag um Tag in grauem Regen,  Suchte ich den Blick noch mal,  War verfallen jenem Zauber,  Den ich bisher nicht erahnt. Blut im Auge  Auf wunde Knie  So sank ich nieder  So fand ich sie Lies zurück der Städte Tore,  Zog hinauf in eisige Höhen  Sturmgewitter, Donners Peitschen  Suchten mich zu Grund zu gehn  Blickte in des Wassers Fälle,  Hinter Sträucher, Birkenhain  Unruhig Blicke, grau die Wogen,  Wo mag sie geblieben sein?

And she was swathed in sorrow, as if born within its mask. Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled. Emptiness followed by her wake. I could clasp her in undying love. Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine. She faced me in awe. 'twas a token of ebony color. Embodied in faint vapor. Wandering through April's fire. Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you. I will endure, hide away. I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure. It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before. The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came The forest folded its branches around me. Something passed by, and I went into a dream. She laughing and weeping at once: ""take me away"".
