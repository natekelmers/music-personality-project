197,Face to face My lovely foe Mouth to mouth Raining heaven's blows Hand on heart Tic tac toe Under the stars Naked as we flow Cheek to cheek The bitter sweet Commit your crime in your deadly time  Commit your crime in your deadly time It's too divine I want to bend I want this bliss but something says I must resist  Another life Another time We're Siamese twins writhing intertwined Face to face No telling lies The masks they slide to reveal a new disguise  You never can win It's the state I'm in This danger thrills and my conflict kills They say follow your heart Follow it through But how can you When you're split in two?  And you'll never know You'll never know  One more kiss Before we die Face to face And dream of flying Who are you? Who am I? Wind in wings Two angels falling To die like this With a last kiss It's falsehood's flame It's a crying shame Face to face The passions breathe I hate to stay but then I hate to leave  And you'll never know You'll never know,,,,

412,There was a life Was there before But somehow here upon this night It now means more And all those words She tried to say I've now forgotten Or they've somehow slipped away And in this darkness Is there salvation Is there forgiveness For hesitation Can someone tell me Can someone say when The writer of this story Will just tell us how it all will end And somewhere on this night There's a wave on the ocean That crashes on shores Where no one can see The tides and the currents Decide every motion From where they are now To where they will be It cradles them all For they all are its children If one drop disappears It is instantly missed And after each wave Has joined up with the shoreline It returns to the sea For that is its one wish There was a light Was there before But in the darkness of this night It now means more To be so close To be so near To see the water there within A young child's tear And in our blindness Do we move onward And cling to the lies That we have harbored We could not admit We were mistaken But if we don't do it now Dear God could you please come Down here And tell me when And somewhere on this night There's a wave on the ocean That crashes on shores Where no one can see The tides and the currents Decide every motion From where they are now To where they will be It cradles them all For they all are its children If one drop disappears It is instantly missed And after each wave Has joined up with the shoreline It returns to the sea For that is its one wish In the dead of the night Tell me what do you see Will you close your eyes child And just listen to me And remember this now Hear these words that I say As your story appears At the end of the day For my meeting with death Though it has been delayed I have run my hands over The end of his blade Though the cut wasn't fatal Even though it was deep Well that wound's never healed And the blood it still seeps Are you scared of your life Are you scared of your death Though that day will arrive Well it hasn't come yet For the days turn to months And the months turn to years As I see them all now Through a prism of tears But don't fear tomorrow And don't fear the night It's where God repairs sorrows That enter your life The remains of your life The remains of the day Well protect every hour Don't give them away For each evening we sleep And each morning we arise But you're not the same man That's the way it's devised For there're parts of yourself The soul decides to keep And there're parts of yourself That the soul does release With some changes so small That they cannot be seen But death is like sleep With a longer dream Are you scared of your life Are you scared of your death Though that day will arrive Well it hasn't come yet As for all those mistakes That you've made in your life Must they stay as they are Or can we make them right On this night take my hand Keep me near keep me close And if I should die first Could I not be your ghost But if later in life We should happen to meet Would you keep me so near You could hear my heartbeat There are reasons to live There are reasons to die But the end's not the end While you're still alive Alive Alive While you're still a There was a life Was there before,,,,

We could welcome the responsibility Like a long lost friend, And re-establish the kingdom of laughter In the dolls house once again. For time has imprisoned us In the order of our years, In the discipline of our ways And in the passing of momentary stillness We can view our chaos in motion And the subsequent collisions of fools Well versed in the subtle art of slavery.",,,,

Probably drinking and smoking out with your crew And chilling with clueless women you trying to bang, bumping New Edition Is that all you think life really is Well if so, then you're a fucking idiot I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain, gimme it! Do you even have any goals Aside from bagging these hoes and packing a bowl Well let me guess, no. You're only in school because your parents make you go When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with your bros Yo, society's got you living for a whack 'cause You're a fucking adult with no skills at all You don't read any books or play ball You don't draw, you literally do nothing at all Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits You don't have 'cause you idolize rappers that do And all they say is ""I got money and it's stacked to the roof"" And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor You pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later Then you complain about your life 'cause it ain't getting catered Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater? You wanna succeed, you have to try Or one day you'll get older and regret it all 'cause you can't provide Your friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice Girls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo Bitch that's a fucking lie You always talk about how every man's fake And you can't take it and you want something real Shut up tramp, save it Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets And head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking Pulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making Till you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement You want Romeo, then act patient And stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin' It's the club, where guys put on a new persona After they get loaded with a few Coronas They always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em Then when they leave you, you cry and cry Talking 'bout, ""oh my god I can't find a guy I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried Why am I even on Earth, I should die!"" You want Romeo, you're not worthy You're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes Sometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching Try a new formula, 'cause your last one's not working The term ""real nigga""'s publicly used And I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fucking confused Are you one for always busting your tool With nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew Is it because you're selling drugs to get loot And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed, like it's fun to be you But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through Nah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve 'Cause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal It's clear you can't stand the law, you're lost as an abandoned dog And all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball I can't even fuck with you, 'cause if we out in public You gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too You'll get old and be nothing Living life in these streets, thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging Look at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you 'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move Your real nigga talk seems bogus A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it And his future doesn't seem hopeless A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused So all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong You inspire the issue I wrote about in this song You go to pile on the young who roam around in the slums See this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums Hope the hour is long when I'm rolling out with your tongue The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong All you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese And the mass control limit was breached, fuck hip-hop! They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see They purposely making the innocent weak My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time It is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine I can guide you if you feel blind I just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mind",,,,

Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.   I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,  But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.

When is the word but a sigh? When is death our lone beholder? When do we walk the final steps? When can we scream instead of whisper? When is the new beginning The end of this sad Madrigal",,,,

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace, And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace, And your basement clothes and your hollow face, Who among them can think he could outguess you? With your silhouette when the sunlight dims Into your eyes where the moonlight swims, And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns, Who among them would try to impress you?

Oh, how could they ever mistake you? They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm, But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm, And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms, How could they ever, ever persuade you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands, Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes, My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums, Should I leave them by your gate, Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait? With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row, And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go, And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show, Who among them do you think would employ you? Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold, And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul, Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands, Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes, My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums, Should I leave them by your gate, Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?",,,,

How could you blame me and my plan of attack, Cause I'm risking my soul attack, now I'm heard all over the map.

They will love it If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans, More than likely I am faded man Doin' other shit get ready where you goin', Niggas just stand around hatin' So my vice ace is when The lights start flashin' 'n' I'll be soaring all alone 'n', In the place my mind is going fill with songs and no-ones knowin' And the devil with the harpin' dress tryin' ask me for one dance, He think he slick but my guardians protects me from his wrath, So in my place no hate shall enter, livin' high up there up there Copin', copin', floatin', I will find peace somewhere In my mind, it sounds like ooh When I'm gone, it feels it likes ooh When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright I forget about it all.

1517,"Existence is a stage on which we pass a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart: it's hopeless, I know, but onward I must go and try to make a start at seeing something more than day to day survival, chased by final death if I believed this the sum of the life to which we've come, I wouldn't waste my breath Somehow, there must be more. There was a time when more was felt than known but now, entrenched inside my sett, in light more mundane, thought rattles round my brain: we live, we die...and yet? In the beginning there was order and destiny but now that path has reached the border, and on our knees is no way to face the future, whatever it be. Though the forces which hold us in place last through eons in unruffled grace we, too, wear the face of creation. As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead, all space is living history. It seems as though time must betray us, yet we're alive and though I see no God to save us, yetl we survive through the centuries of progress which don't get us very far. All illusion! All is bogus - we don't yet know what we are... Laughing, hoping, praying, joking, Son of Man! with lowered eyes but lifting hearts, we're grains of sand and though, in time, the sea may claim us for its own we are the rocks which root the future - on us it grows! We might not be there to share it if eternity's a jest but I think that I can bear it if the next life is the best. Even if there is a heaven when we die, endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie that always comes as answer to the question, ""Why do we see through the eyes of creation?"" Adrift without a course, it's very lonely here, our only conjecture what lies behind the dark. Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline, think of a lifetime which means more than my own one - dreams of a grander thing than we are. Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders: when all life is over who can say no mutated force shall remain? Though the towers of the city are denied to we men of clay still we know we shall scale the heights some day. Frightened in the silence - frightened, but thinking very hard, let us make computations of the stars. Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run: faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes: colour blisters, image splinters gravitate towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate, The universe now beckons and Man, too, must take His place... just a few last fleeting seconds to wander in the waste, and the children who were ourselves move on, reincarnation stills its now perfected song, and at last we are free of the bonds of creation. All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies and slavers too, all the throng who have danced a merry tune - human we can all be, but Humanity we must rise above, in the name of all faith and hope and love. There's a time for all pilgrims, and a time for the fakers too, there's a time when we all will stand alone and nude, naked to the galaxies - naked, but clothed in the overview... as we reach Childhood's End we must start anew. And though dark is the highway, and the peak's distance breaks my heart, for I never shall see it, still I play my part, believing that what waits for us is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past... In the death of mere humans life shall start",,,,

over little shit, up on the block Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock Working overtime for making money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treating him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club But only a real thug can stab someone till they die Standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well guarded And they wanted to test him, before business started Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted So now he had a choice between going back to his life Or making money with made men, up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot They drove around the projects slow while it was raining Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he had broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned A broken jaw mumbled for God but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head I'm falling and I can't turn back I'm falling and I can't turn back Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter Cause he was starring into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully, than when they were raping her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted You have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted And you'll be one of Gods children and fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because the dance with the devil might last you forever",,,,
