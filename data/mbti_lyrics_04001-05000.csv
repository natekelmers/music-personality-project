Will you still kiss me the same when you taste my victim's blood? So crimson and red, I feel it flowing from your lips My heart is dead and so are you And it pulses through, the desire to change The desire to deconstruct all of my past failings But where to begin because when you live in sin It's hard to look at saints without them Reflecting their jet black auras back on you And all I have is hope, my inner burn's not fading I'll wipe the blood from my cheek and get on with my day And all I have is hope, and all I need is time To bury in pine under six feet of time The lies I told me about myself Claw my way out, pick the splinters from under my fingernails I won't lose hope, I won't give in Just live and breathe and try not to die again",,

The longer we wait around The faster the years go by It's not too late To feel a little more alive Make our escape Before we start to vaporize Doubtless, we've been through this So if you want to follow me you should know I was lost then and I am lost now And I doubt I'll ever know which way to go",,

She is the new thing. It started so slight then I flared into life, Attention again onto another new thing. Once she had me on my knees, enamoured with disease. Now, she fails to impress. A different sickness. A different kind of sickness, Lacking any interest. And I, sunk in apathy, Totally absorbed in me. Sitting vacant on my own, My senses lying prone. She was the new thing. Feel my stomach sink and I curse my slow limbs. Staring at her, Alterior girl, I cast myself into whatever she brings...Another new. With sickness, It ends how it begins: First mine then hers, And then the cycle blurs as my actions reoccur through no fault of my own, through no fault of my own.",,

973,The willow it weeps today A breeze from the distance is calling your name Unfurl your black wings and wait Across the horizon it's coming to sweep you away It's coming to sweep you away Let the wind carry you home Blackbird fly away May you never be broken again The fragile cannot endure The wrecked and the jaded a place so impure The static of this cruel world Cause some birds to fly long before they've seen their day Long before they've seen their day Let the wind carry you home Blackbird fly away May you never be broken again Beyond the suffering you've known I hope you find your way May you never be broken again Ascend may you find no resistance Know that you made such a difference All you leave behind will live to the end The cycle of suffering goes on But memories of you stay strong Someday I too will fly and find you again Let the wind carry you home Blackbird fly away May you never be broken again Beyond the suffering you've known I hope you find your way May you never be broken again May you never be broken again,,
