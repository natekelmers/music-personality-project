471,"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, Rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!",,,,

Guess what I received In the mail today Words of deep concern From my little brother The building's not goin' as he planned The foreman has injured his hand The dozer will not clear a path The driver swears he learned his math The workers are goin' home!

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth, And I love the riddles that you speak, And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored, 'Cause my heart is yours. So don't you worry your pretty little mind, People throw rocks at things that shine, And life makes love look hard, And don't you worry your pretty little mind, People throw rocks at things that shine, But they can't take what's ours, They can't take what's ours, The stakes are high, The water's rough, But this love is ours.",,,,

Every disappointment's and mistake, Some resentment from a one-night heartbreak. My head is spinning My hands go damp, But still I force an introduction And I ask you to dance. You feel like home up against me so close, Though we've just met tonight . There's still so much that we still don't know, But I'm fairly certain That we just might work out right. Then again it can all go up in flames, And I'll take you down in the name of love. But for now let's kiss hard, Fuck the games. All or nothing, it's written in blood On the way to the wedding, Dressed in black, she said ""Sorry lover but you can't look back."" She says ""Oh no, "" she goes, ""Oh no, "" she goes ""Slow down baby or you're gonna explode."" On the way to the wedding, Dressed in black, he said ""Sorry lover but you can't look back."" She says ""Oh no, "" she goes, ""Oh no, "" she goes ""Slow down baby keep your eyes on the road"" Soft wet skin, hairs raised, body tired; And the sheets are across the floor. You tell me that love don't last, Drawing circles with your fingernails across my back. As your lips form the words you won't say, In the distance your favorite song plays. I turn you over and look in your eyes, Promise you that this is forever Or till one of us dies. You taste like tear stains And could have beens, But I love a good train wreck. Your hair balled up inside my fist, You tell me don't get too attatched Like this is just entertainment. Then again it could go up in flames, And I'll take you down in the name of love. Maybe one last kiss just to ease the pain All or nothing it's written in blood On the way to the wedding, Dressed in black, she said ""Sorry lover but you can't look back."" She says ""Oh no, "" she goes, ""Oh no, "" she goes ""Slow down baby or you're gonna explode."" On the way to the wedding, Dressed in black, he said ""Sorry lover but you can't look back.""

That I'd feel colder when I walk alone (Oh, but you'll survive) So I may as well ditch my dismay (Bombs away Bombs away) Circle me and the needles moves gracefully Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home It makes me smile because you said it best I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the west Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you Cause your favorite shade is navy blue I walk slowly when I'm on my own (Do you feel alive?) Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone (Oh, but you'll survive) So I may as well ditch my dismay (Bombs away Bombs away) Circle me and the needles moves gracefully Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home If my heart was a house, you'd be home",,,,
