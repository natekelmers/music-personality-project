And will you never say that you love me Just to put it in my face? And will you never try to reach me? It is I that wanted space Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways Yeah, ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you I'm sober now for three whole months, It's one accomplishment that you helped me with The one thing that always tore us apart Is the one thing I won't touch again In a sick way I want to thank you For holding my head up late at night While I was busy waging wars on myself, You were trying to stop the fight You never doubted my warped opinions On things like suicidal hate You made me compliment myself When it was way too hard to take So I'll drive so fucking far away That I never cross your mind And do whatever it takes in your heart To leave me behind Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways Yeah, ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave Kicking shadows on the street For every mistake that I had made And like a baby boy, I never was a man Until I saw your blue eyes crying, And I held your face in my hand And then I fell down yelling, ""make it go away!"" Just make a smile come back And shine just like it used to be And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?"" Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways Yeah, ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you For you For you For you",,
1,When I grow up I want to be a forester Run through the moss on high heels That's what I'll do Throwing out boomerang Waiting for it to come back to me When I grow up I want to live near the sea Crab claws and bottles of rum That's what I'll have Staring at the seashell Waiting for it to embrace me I put my soul in what I do Last night I drew a funny man With dark eyes and a hanging tongue It goes way bad I never liked a sad look From someone who wants to be loved by you I'm very good with plants When my friends are away They let me keep the soil moist On the seventh day I rest For a minute or two Then back on my feet and cry for you You've got cucumbers on your eyes Too much time spent on nothing Waiting for a moment to arise The face in the ceiling And arms too long I wait for him to catch me Waiting for you to embrace me,,

Long time ago, he was disgraced from the gods,  For failing his duties to restore order in the realm.  He found the love of an elven maid,  Let his minions kill his wife.  The gods threw a fiery mountain  On the city of Istar,  To punish the arrogance of the high priest.  To The Catavlysm, to the end of the world.  ""noctem, redde tuae, dux bone, patriae!""  Dawning in the lands of the damned.  A new morning went by  In the darkened halls of the fallen one;  As many others did.  Condemned to await the end of all days,  Guided by the cries of banshees.  Dead and forgotten mortals,  A life without light,  A life without the warmth of blood.  Rise and fall - an empire to lose  Fall and rise - a cataclysm to come  Rise and fall - the sea changed blood red  Fall and rise - for a new order",,

She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend, Even though she only has one or two. She's always done much better with boys anyway, So who needs girlfriends? Pacing nervous across the floor of her bedroom, Gripping tight the phone in her hand. Fighting beck the rush of emotions, And dreaming of just having a man. It's a long walk, and the music is loud. She sees an old friend, As she walks through the crowd. Puts on her best smile, But underneath she's a broken girl. But It's a long walk, and the music is loud. She sees an old friend, As she walks through the crowd. Puts on her best smile, But she will always be a broken girl. She struggles with an awful decision, Stay at home or walk in alone. Her mother does her best to console her, Her father doesn't know what to say. Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress. Holds her head high, then gets in the car. Tells herself that no one will notice, Assuming she can make it that far. On the way she imagines reactions. Cupped hands whispering into ears. Secretly hoping that he'll be there watching, And she's also hoping he won't. Walking tentative alone up the driveway, Sees some people smoking off to the side. She stops and waits until they go back in, Crosses her fingers and follows behind. It's a long walk, and the music is loud. She sees an old friend, As she walks through the crowd. Puts on her best smile, But underneath she's a broken girl. But It's a long walk, and the music is loud. She sees an old friend, As she walks through the crowd.

Vanquish the strangle horse? that the netherworld sent for me The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies Bathed in blood up to my horses bridle It's death to retreat there's no chance of survival Wet with your blood I sharpen my sword No turning the other cheek like a coward Come tomorrow I may lay down and die But not this day This day we fight! Stripped of fallen heroes ? are wounded Collect the spoils of war And send them the dead This day we fight!,,

Do you believe in rock and roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rolling stone But, that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin' Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye And singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singin' Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye And singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die They were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singin' this'll be the day that I die",,

Will I burn in eternal hell or will I find paradise? Be rejected or resurrected like the body of Christ? Is it like purgatory, the story described by the Catholics? Or Nirvana that Buddhists honor in both theory and practice? Like I study in my college philosophy classes Or do my molecules and atoms travel back to the gases? I mean, what I like to know, is where my spirit goes? After the curtains close, on my final show? Is there a pain it brings? Enjoy my favorite things? Visit ancient kings? Hear the angels sing?
