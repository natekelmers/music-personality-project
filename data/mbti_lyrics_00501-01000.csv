1,What would you do if you turned around And saw me beside you Not in a dream but in a song? Would you float like a phantom Or would you sing along? Don't know where I'm going Don't know where it's flowing But I know it's finding you What would you do If you saw me driving by in a car The quickest you've ever seen me spin? Would you smile and wave Or would you bow and get in? Don't know where I'm going Don't know where it's flowing But I know it's finding you But then the lightning finds us Burns away our kindness We can't find a place to hide Come the rainy season Surrender to our treasons Can we even find our tears? Don't know where I'm going Don't know where it's flowing  But I know it's finding you,,

How do you do!? Now you gonna die!"" Yeah that's what I told 'em Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes And he went down, but to my surprise He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear But I busted a chair right across his teeth And we crashed through the wall and into the street Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer I tell ya, I've fought tougher men But I really can't remember when He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss He went for his gun and I pulled mine first He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile And he said, ""Son, this world is rough And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough And I know I wouldn't be there to help ya along So I give ya that name and I said goodbye I knew you'd have to get tough or die And it's the name that helped to make you strong"" Yeah he said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight And I know you hate me, and you got the right To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do But ya ought to thank me, before I die For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye 'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue"" Yeah what could I do, what could I do I got all choked up and I threw down my gun Called him my Pa, and he called me his son And I come away with a different point of view And I think about him, now and then Every time I try and every time I win And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him Bill or George!

78,"I was crawling around in my head in the haze of a trance Rico said, ""I'ma turn you onto a sound, cool out your head This is the sound from Camden town."" And then I heard it like a shot from my skull to my brain I felt my fingertips tingle and it started to rain When the walls of my bedroom were tremblin' around me This ramshackle voice over attack of a blues beat Tellin' me ""He's only looking for fun"" And this was the sound of the very last gang in town As heard by my wild young heart like directions on a cold dark night Sayin' ""Let it out, let it out, let it out  You're doin' all right."" And I heard it in his chain gang soul How it wasn't just the same sad song Sayin' ""Let it out, let it out, let it out You're doin' all right."" And I carried these songs like a comfort wherever I'd go And they was there when my summers was high  And there when she left me alone. Saying, ""the soul is hard to find"" And I never got to tell him so I just wrote it down I wrapped a couple chords around it and I let it come out When the walls of my bedroom trembled around me This ramshackle voice over attack of a blues beat And a girl, on the excitement gang And this was the sound of the very last gang in town As heard by my wild young heart like directions on a cold dark night Sayin', ""Let it out, let it out, let it out  You're doin' all right."" And I heard it in his chain gang soul How it wasn't just the same sad song Sayin', ""Let it out, let it out, let it out You're doin' all right."" That was the sound I hear the sound Do you hear the sound? I hear the sound Of the very last gang in town",,

The love in you, it does not burn, There is no lesson you can learn And there are sounds you cannot hear, And there are feelings you canÂ´t feel Calm down my heart... donÂ´t beat so fast...
