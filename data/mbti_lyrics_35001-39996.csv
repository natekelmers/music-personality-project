Symphony match-seller, breath out of time - You can call me on another line. Indian restaurants that curry my brain. Newspaper warriors changing the names they advertise from the station Stand. With cold print hands. Symphony word-player, I'll be your headline. If you catch me another time. Didn't make her - with my Baker Street Ruse. Couldn't shake her - with my Baker Street Bruise. Like to take her - I'm just a Baker Street Muse. Ale-spew, puddle-brew - boys, throw it up clean. Coke and Bacardi colours them green. From the typing pool goes the mini-skirted princess with great finesse. Fertile earth-mother, your burial mound is fifty feet down in the Baker Street underground. What the Hell? I didn't make her - with my Baker Street Ruse. Couldn't shake her - with my Baker Street Bruise. Like to take her - I'm just a Baker Street Muse. Walking down the gutter thinking, ""How the Hell am I today?"" Well, I didn't really ask you but thanks all the same. Big bottled Fraulein, put your weight on me, "" said the pig-me to the Whore, desperate for more in his assault upon the mountain. Little man, his youth a fountain. Overdrafted and still counting. Vernacular, verbose; an attempt at getting close to where he came from. In the doorway of the stars, between Blandford Street and Mars; Proposition, deal. Flying button feel. Testicle testing. Wallet ever-bulging. Dressed to the left, divulging the wrinkles of his Years. Wedding-bell induced fears. Shedding bell-end tears in the pocket of her resistance. International assistance flowing generous and full to his never-ready tool. Pulls his eyes over her wool. And he shudders as he comes - And my rudder slowly turns me into the Marylebone Road. And here slip I - dragging one foot in the gutter - In the midnight echo of the shop that sells cheap radios. And there sits she - no bed, no bread nor butter - On a double yellow line where she can park anytime. Old Lady Grey; Crash-barrier Waltzer - Some only son's mother. Baker Street casualty. Oh, Mr. Policeman - blue shirt ballet master. Feet in sticking plaster - Move the old lady on. Strange pas-de-deux - His Romeo to her Juliet. Her sleeping draught his poisoned regret. No drunken bums allowed to sleep here in the crowded emptiness. Oh officer, oh let me send her to a cheap hotel - I'll pay the bill and make her well - like hell you bloody will! No do-good over kill. We must teach them to be still more independent I have no time for Time Magazine or Rolling Stone. I have no wish for wishing-wells or wishing bones. I have no house in the country I have no motor-car. And if you think I'm joking, then I'm just a one-line joker in a public Bar. And it seems there's no-body left for tennis; and I'm a one-band-man. And I want no Top Twenty funeral or a hundred grand. There was a little boy stood on a burning log, rubbing his hands with glee. He said, ""Oh Mother England, did you light my smile; or did you light This fire under me? One day I'll be a minstrel in the gallery. And paint you a picture of the queen. And if sometimes I sing to a cynical degree - It's just the nonsense that it seems. So I drift down through the Baker Street valley, in my steep-sided Un-reality. And when all's said and all's done - couldn't wish for a better one. It's a real-life ripe dead-certainty - that I'm just a Baker Street Muse. Talking to the gutter-stinking, winking in the same old way. I tried to catch my eye but I looked the other way.

Little worse for wear, but I'm wearing it well. Tell me what's wrong with a little grind and bump When the stereos erupt with a kick-drum punch? Once you do it once, probably do it again and again. You did it before, but you're more erratic then them. And you had a rough night, and the vibe's just begun. Let a little bit of this, the past week is done.

Gut bucket and a bottle of pains. It's like the schoolhouse lights will never turn on again. Till the bottom wears off of these high-heeled boots. The bodies all move, some backbone roots. Everybody workin' hard till the yard's all clean. The dishes wash good in the washin' machine. Now you brush your teeth and you comb back your hair. You drive your vehicle like you just didn't care.

With your hand like a mirror, you can see what's inside. When you're down and out, poundin' and there's nothing that's real. It's like a plastic heart, too amputated to feel. I got a soda can bible song, paranoid Jumbotron. The lord took the weekend off. The fly on the wall doesn't know what's wrong. If I could forget myself, find another lie to tell. The bottom of an oil well, cell phone's ringing To talk to my brain cells. Come on! What!? All the dudes with banjos. Chicks with the wigs. Animals with bananas. Got my hand like a mirror.

Shadows on the hills Sketch the trees and the daffodils Catch the breeze and the winter chills In colors on the snowy linen land. And now I understand what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free. They would not listen They did not know how Perhaps they'll listen now. Starry Starry night Flaming flo'rs that brightly blaze Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue. Colors changing hue Morning fields of amber grain Weathered faces lined in pain Are soothed beneath the artist's Loving hand. And now I understand what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free. Perhaps they'll listen now. For they could not love you But still your love was true And when no hope was left in sight on that starry Starry night. You took your life As lovers often do; But I could have told you Vincent This world was never Meant for one As beautiful as you. Starry Starry night Portraits hung in empty halls Frameless heads on nameless walls With eyes That watch the world and can't forget. Like the stranger that you've met The ragged men in ragged clothes The silver thorn of bloody rose Lie crushed and broken On the virgin snow. And now I think I know what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free. They would not listen They're not List'ning still Perhaps they never will.,,,,

And who says the hunt has begun? And who calls the tune in the courtroom? And who beats the funeral drum? The memories of a man in his old age Are the deeds of a man in his prime. You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom And talk to yourself till you die.",,,,

But all this year's been a busy blur Don't think I have the energy To add to my already mad rush Just 'cause it's 'tis the season. The perfect gift for me would be Completions and connections left from last year. Ski shop encounter most interesting. Had his number but never the time, Most of '81 passed along those lines. So deck those halls. Trim those trees. Raise up cups of Christmas cheer. I just need to catch my breath; Christmas by myself this year Calendar picture. Frozen landscape, Chill this room for twenty-four days. Evergreens. Sparkling snow. Get this winter over with! Flash back to spring time saw him again Would have been good to go for lunch. Couldn't agree when we were both free. We tried, we said we'd keep in touch. Didn't of course 'till summer time, Out to the beach to his boat. Could I join him? No. This time it was me; Sunburn in the third degree. Now the calendar's just one page Of course I am excited. Tonight's the night I've set my mind Not to do too much about it.

Merry Christmas; Merry Christmas But I think I'll miss this one this year. Merry Christmas; Merry Christmas But I think I'll miss this one this year. Hardly dashing through the snow 'Cause I bundled up too tight. Last minute have-to-dos: A few cards, a few calls Because it's RSVP. No, thanks. No party lights. It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax, Turn down all of my invites. Last fall I had a night to myself Same guy called; Halloween party. Waited all night for him to show. This time his car wouldn't go. Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late. Trudge on home to celebrate. In a quiet way unwind. Doing Christmas right this time. And he has provided me With the world's smallest turkey. Already in the oven, nice and hot. Oh damn! Guess what I forgot. So on with the boots Back out in the snow To the only all night grocery. When what to my wondering eyes should appear In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year. 'Spending this one alone, ' he said. 'Give me a break, this year's been crazy.' I said 'Me too, but why are you.. You mean you forgot cranberries too?' Then suddenly we laughed and laughed. Caught on to what was happening. That Christmas magic's brought this tale To a very happy ending. Merry Christmas; Merry Christmas Couldn't miss this one this year. Merry Christmas; Merry Christmas Couldn't miss this one this year.

But I am only talking to myself 'cause she isn't there. My sister, I love my sister, she's the best. She's cooler than any other girl that I have ever met. She had the greatest band, she had the greatest guy. She's good at everything and doesn't even try. She's got a wall around her nobody can climb. She lets her ladder down for those who really shine. I tried to scale it, but to me she's blind. So I lit a firecracker, went off in my eye. I miss my sister, why'd she go ? She's the one who would have taken me To my first all-ages show. It was the violent femmes and the del fuegos, Before they had a record out.  Before they went gold, And started to grow. I miss my sister.  I miss my sister. I miss my sister.

'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate. They walked along by the old canal A little confused, I remember well And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright. He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train Moving with a simple twist of fate. A saxophone someplace far off played As she was walkin' by the arcade. As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up, She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate. He woke up, the room was bare He didn't see her anywhere. He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide, Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate. He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks, Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in. Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait Once more for a simple twist of fate. People tell me it's a sin To know and feel too much within. I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring. She was born in spring, but I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate.",,,,

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond.

Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Ma and pa look back on all the things they used to do, Never had no money and they always told the truth, Daddy didn't need no little toys, Mommy didn't need no little boys, wont you tell me, Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Where have all the good times gone. Ow! Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play, Ah but then lets face it, things are easier today, Yes you need some bringing down, Get your feet back on the ground, Where have all the good times gone.

You must be kidding me! Love without teardrops isn't the same He asked to be counted out of her game She thought it him who was so insane Love is what it does by any other name,,,,

4187,We can fight our desires  But when we start making fires  We get ever so hot  Whether we like it or not They say we can love who we trust But what is love without lust?  Two hearts with accurate devotions  And what are feelings without emotions?  I'm going in for the kill  I'm doing it for a thrill  Oh I'm hoping you'll understand  And not let go of my hand I'm going in for the kill  I'm doing it for a thrill  Oh I'm hoping you'll understand  And not let go of my hand I hang my hopes out on the line  Will they be ready for you in time  If you leave them out too long  They'll be withered by the sun  Full stops and exclamation marks  My words stumble before I start  How far can you send emotions?  Can this bridge cross the ocean?  I'm going in for the kill  I'm doing it for a thrill  Oh I'm hoping you'll understand  And not let go of my hand  I'm going in for the kill  I'm doing it for a thrill  Oh I'm hoping you'll understand  And not let go of my hand Let's go to war To make peace Let's be cold To create heat I hope in darkness We can see And you're not blinded by the light from me  I'm going in for the kill  I'm doing it for a thrill  Oh I'm hoping you'll understand  And not let go of my hand,,,,

4245,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls. You're a soldier of mercy, you're cold and you curse, ""He who cannot be trusted must fall."" Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety. You fight for the throne and you travel alone Unknown as you slowly sink And there's no time to think. In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity, In secret, for pieces of change. The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you And it makes you feel violent and strange. Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss In the valley of the missing link And you have no time to think. Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you Her worst is better than best. I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes And I feel so depressed. China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality. Mercury rules you and destiny fools you Like the plague, with a dangerous wink And there's no time to think. Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you Where the lion lies down with the lamb. I'd have paid off the traitor and killed him much later But that's just the way that I am. Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality. But the magician is quicker and his game Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink And there's no time to think. Anger and jealousy's all that he sells us, He's content when you're under his thumb. Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him To survive it you play deaf and dumb. Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity. You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear At the back of your head as you drink And there's no time to think. Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow Will offer their heads for a prayer. You can't find no salvation, you have no expectations Anytime, anyplace, anywhere. Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility. You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper That is leading you onto the brink But there's no time to think. You've murdered your vanity, buried your sanity For pleasure you must now resist. Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you They're not even sure you exist. Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism. Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws And the sound of the keys as they clink But there's no time to think. The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl With the rose in her hair. Starlight in the East and you're finally released You're stranded but with nothing to share. Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity. You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'Neath the moon shinin' bloody and pink And there's no time to think. Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you But no, you will not be deceived. Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, You can give but you cannot receive. No time to choose when the truth must die, No time to lose or say goodbye, No time to prepare for the victim that's there, No time to suffer or blink And no time to think.",,,,

The news had come out in the First World War  The bloody Red Baron was flying once more  The Allied command ignored all of its men  And called on Snoopy to do it again.  Was the night before Christmas, 40 below  When Snoopy went up in search of his foe  He spied the Red Baron, fiercely they fought  With ice on his wings Snoopy knew he was caught.  Christmas bells those Christmas bells  Ring out from the land  Asking peace of all the world  And good will to man  The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights  He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight  Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know  Or was it the bells from the village below.  Christmas bells those Christmas bells  Ringing through the land  Bringing peace to all the world  And good will to man  The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine  And forced him to land behind the enemy lines  Snoopy was certain that this was the end  When the Baron cried out, ""Merry Christmas, my friend""  The Baron then offered a holiday toast  And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host  And then with a roar they were both on their way  Each knowing they'd meet on some other day.  Christmas bells those Christmas bells  Ringing through the land  Bringing peace to all the world  And good will to man",,,,

Like a priceless jewel, Buried in dark layers of soil and stone. Earth radiates her brilliant beauty, Into the caverns of space and time. Perhaps you are aware of those who watch over your home, And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality. You are becoming aware of yourself as a gamemaster. Imagine Earth restored to her regal beauty. Stately trees seem to brush the deep blue sky. Clouds billow to form majestic peaks. The songs of birds fill the air, Creating symphony upon symphony. The goddess is calling for and honoring Of what she allows to be created From the core-mystery of the blood. Those who own her planet are learning about love.",,,,

There may be a kingdom for me somewhere. If you only knew. Then you are a king? It's you that say I am. I look for truth and find that I get damned. But what is truth? Is truth a changing law? We both have truths. Are mine the same as yours? Crucify him! Crucify him! What do you mean? You'd crucify your king? We have no king but Caesar! He's done no wrong. No, not the slightest thing.

We have no King but Caesar. You hypocrites, You hate us more than him. We have no King but Caesar, Crucify him! I see no reason. I find no evil. This man is harmless, so why does he upset you? He's just misguided, thinks he's important, But to keep you vultures happy I shall flog him. Crucify him! Crucify him! Where are you from Jesus? What do you want Jesus? Tell me. You've got to be careful. You could be dead soon, Could well be. Why do you not speak when I hold your life in my hands? How can you stay quiet? I don't believe you understand. You have nothing in your hands. Any power you have, comes to you from far beyond. Everything is fixed, and you can't change it. You're a fool Jesus Christ. How can I help you? Pilate, Crucify him!

Like a priceless jewel, Buried in dark layers of soil and stone. Earth radiates her brilliant beauty, Into the caverns of space and time. Perhaps you are aware of those who watch over your home, And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality. You are becoming aware of yourself as a gamemaster. Imagine Earth restored to her regal beauty. Stately trees seem to brush the deep blue sky. Clouds billow to form majestic peaks. The songs of birds fill the air, Creating symphony upon symphony. The goddess is calling for and honoring Of what she allows to be created From the core-mystery of the blood. Those who own her planet are learning about love.",,,"If you want to live inside my head Want to see what I have said I will make you tremble You'll tremble Its fine with me If you want to scream outside my door Ill make you holler even more I will make you sorry So sorry Its fine with me I will make you undertsand forever Ill make everybody disappear I will make you hold my hand forever Till I am standing clear Magical Mystical Lifes a ball Never had a girl like you Insecure Give me more Not so sure Never had a girl like you Starry eyed Clarified Over lied Never had a girl like you I will make you sacrifice the lot Once you see What I have got I can be deceitful, deceitful It's fine with me I will make you get inside my car Then I'll drive you very far I can make you breathless So breathless It's fine with me You know I'm watching you That's all I ever do Your hands, your hair You're everywhere I see You know I am watching you Just trying to see through Those crazy words You keep on serving me Tu sais que je te vois Je fais ca tout le temps Tes main, (tes) cheuveux Tu es partous, toujours Tu sais que je te vois Je tente de reveller Le mots bizzares Que tu veux me donner",
