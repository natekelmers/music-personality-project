When will all my hopes arise? How will I know him? When I look in my fatherÂ´s eyes. My fatherÂ´s eyes. When I look in my fatherÂ´s eyes. My fatherÂ´s eyes.

What do we play? Bit by bit, IÂ´ve realized ThatÂ´s when I need them, ThatÂ´s when I need my fatherÂ´s eyes. My fatherÂ´s eyes. ThatÂ´s when I need my fatherÂ´s eyes. My fatherÂ´s eyes.

Christmas bells those Christmas bells  Ring out from the land  Asking peace of all the world  And good will to man  The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights  He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight  Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know  Or was it the bells from the village below.  Christmas bells those Christmas bells  Ringing through the land  Bringing peace to all the world  And good will to man  The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine  And forced him to land behind the enemy lines  Snoopy was certain that this was the end  When the Baron cried out, ""Merry Christmas, my friend""  The Baron then offered a holiday toast  And Snoopy, our hero, saluted his host  And then with a roar they were both on their way  Each knowing they'd meet on some other day.

1270,,"It was an April morning when they told us we should go As I turn to you, you smiled at me How could we say no? Oh, the fun to have To live the dreams we always had Oh, the songs to sing When we at last return again Slipping off a glancing kiss To those who claim they know Below the streets that steam and hiss The devil's in his hole Oh, to sail away To sandy lands and other days Oh, to touch the dream Hides inside and never seen, yeah Into the sun, the south, the north At last the birds have flown The shackles of commitment fell In pieces on the ground Oh, to ride the wind To tread the air above the din Oh, to laugh aloud Dancing as we fought the crowds, yeah To seek the man whose pointing hand The giant step unfolds With guidance from the curving path That churns up into stone If one bell should ring In celebration for a king So fast the heart should beat As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah Days went by when you and I Bathed in eternal summer's glow As far away and distant Our mutual child did grow Oh the sweet refrain Soothes the soul and calms the pain Oh Albion remains Sleeping now to rise again Wandering and wandering What place to rest the search? The mighty arms of Atlas Hold the heavens from the earth For the mighty arms of Atlas Hold the heavens from the earth From the earth I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh For the mighty arms of Atlas Hold the heavens from the earth Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah",,,,,,,,

1418,"They heard me singing and they told me to stop, Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock, These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose, But late at night the feelings swim to the surface. 'Cause on the suburbs the city lights shine, They're calling at me, 'come and find your kind.' Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small, Then we can never get away from the sprawl, Living in the sprawl, Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains, And there's no end in sight, I need the darkness someone please cut the lights. We rode our bikes to the nearest park, Sat under the swings, we kissed in the dark, We shield our eyes from the police lights, We run away, but we don't know why, And like a mirror these city lights shine, They're screaming at us, 'we don't need your kind' Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small, Then we can never get away from the sprawl, Living in the sprawl, Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains, And there's no end in sight, I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.
