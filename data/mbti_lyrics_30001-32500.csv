I've been so far from here Far from your warm arms It's good to feel you again It's been a long long time Hasn't it?  I know a farmer who looks after the farm With water clear, he cares for all his harvest I know a fireman who looks after the fire You, can't you see he's fooled you all Yes, he's here again Can't you see he's fooled you all? Share his peace, sign the lease He's a supersonic scientist He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man Look, look into my mouth he cries And all the children lost down many paths I bet my life you'll walk inside  Hand in hand Gland in gland  With a spoonful of miracle He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary We will rock you, rock you little snake We will keep you snug and warm Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest We walked across the fields to see the children of the West But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground Waiting for battle The fight's begun, they've been released Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang Bang, bang, bang And they've given me a wonderful potion 'Cause I cannot contain my emotion And even though I'm feeling good Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord Wandering in the chaos the battle has left We climb up the mountain of human flesh To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life A young figure sits still by a pool He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool He is you Social Security took care of this lad We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower A flower?

I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms Now I'm back again And babe, it's gonna work out fine Can't you feel our souls ignite? Shedding ever-changing colours In the darkness of the fading night Like the river joins the ocean As the germ in a seed grows  We have finally been freed to get back home There's an angel standing in the sun And he's crying with a loud voice ""This is the supper of the mighty one"" Lord of Lords, King of Kings Has returned to lead his children home To take them to the new Jerusalem",,,,

I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories. Beg to hear your wonderous stories. He spoke of lands not far Or lands they were in his mind. Of fusion captured high Where reason captured his time. In no time at all he took me to the gate. In haste I quickly checked the time. If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories. Had to hear your wonderous stories. Hearing Hearing Hearing your wonderous stories. Hearing your wonderous stories. It is no lie I can see deeply into the future. Imagine everything You're close And were you there to stand So cautiously at first and then so high. As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky. I bid it to return To hear your wonderous stories. Return to hear your wonderous stories. Hearing, Hearing, Hearing, Hearing, Hearing,",,,,

Stagnation Here today the red sky tells his tale, But the only listening eyes are mine There is peace amongst the hills, And the night will cover all my pride. Blest are they who smile from bodies free, Seems to me like any other crowd Who are waiting to be saved. Wait, there is still time for washing in the pool, Wash away the past Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above, Smiling at my tears. Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home, Keep outside the night. The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead, Somehow And each will find a home, And there will still be time, For loving my friend You are there And will I wait for ever, beside the silent mirror And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds And slimy water. I want to sit down. I want to take a drink of water I want a drink I want a drink. To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat. I want a drink. I want a drink. To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts. I want a drink. Then let us drink Then let us smile Then let us go","See my hand is moving Touching all that's real And once it stroke the love's body Now it claws the past The scent of a flower, The colors of the morning, Friends to believe in, Tears soon forgotten, See how the rain drives away, another day If a leaf has fallen Does the tree lie broken? And if we draw some water Does the well run dry? The sigh of a mother, The screaming of lovers, Like two angry tigers, They tear at each other See how for him lifetime's fears disappear Once a Jesus suffered, Heaven could not see him. And now my ship is sinking, The captain stands alone. A pawn on the chessboard, A false move by God will now destroy me, But wait, on the horizon, A new dawn seems to be rising, Never to recall this passerby, born to die.",,,

I hear the horses' thunder Down in the valley blow, I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, Waiting for the eastern glow. The apples of the valley hold, The seas of happiness, The ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no. Oh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light. The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red. Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly. The sky is filled with good and bad That mortals never know. Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow, Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow. The pain of war cannot exceed The woe of aftermath, The drums will shake the castle wall, The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on. Sing as you raise your bow, Shoot straighter than before. No comfort has the fire at night That lights the face so cold. Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the mornin' light. The magic runes are writ in gold To bring the balance back, bring it back. At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by, With flames from the dragon of darkness The sunlight blinds his eyes.",,,,

672,"I watched the rain; it settled in. We disappeared for days again. Most of us were staying in, lazy like the sky. The letters flew across the wire filtered through a million liars. The whole world smelled like burning tires the day John Henry died. We knew about that big machine that ran on human hope and steam. Bets on John were far between and mostly on the side. We heard he put up quite a fight. His hands and feet turned snowy white. That hammer rang out through the night the day John Henry died. When John Henry was a little bitty baby nobody ever taught him how to read But he knew the perfect way to hold a hammer was the way the railroad baron held the deed. It didn't matter if he won, if he lived, or if he'd run.  They changed the way his job was done. Labor costs were high. That new machine was cheap as hell and only John would work as well, So they left him laying where he fell the day John Henry died. John Henry was a steel-driving bastard but John Henry was a bastard just the same. An engine never thinks about his daddy and an engine never needs to write its name. So pack your bags, we're headed west and L.A. ain't no place to rest. You'll need some sleep to pass the test, so get some on the flight And say your prayers John Henry Ford 'cause we don't need your work no more.

982,Jotun  I often dream of huge numb buildings  Jet-black sinister architecture  Being installed when nobody sees  Their appearance so sudden  That few would take notice  And when I wake up  I imagine being crushed by one  Imagining its weight its silence  And the absence of excuses for a havoced life  And the privilege of a 22-kilometer tombstone  Jotun  A body of black  That carried no reflection  Defying its own room  Un-earthly eggs of decreation  There would be colonies  Mushroom-scattered forever out of context  Rising spores from a dying world  To pollute to chase away what´s left  Sun-white pulverized desert stone  And serpentine lizard mouths  Pales away the pyramids  Rewriting forty five hundred years of history  Raping the statue of liberty  Outplays the Acropolis  Inverting the fjords  Invades the n why skyline to  Dream its own existence in one single final word  Jotun  Can we identify them  As the flint buried in our reptile skulls  Or the time-bomb coded in our dna,,,,

I've been so far from here Far from your warm arms It's good to feel you again It's been a long long time Hasn't it?

Share his peace, sign the lease He's a supersonic scientist He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man Look, look into my mouth he cries And all the children lost down many paths I bet my life you'll walk inside  Hand in hand Gland in gland  With a spoonful of miracle He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary We will rock you, rock you little snake We will keep you snug and warm Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest We walked across the fields to see the children of the West But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground Waiting for battle The fight's begun, they've been released Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang Bang, bang, bang And they've given me a wonderful potion 'Cause I cannot contain my emotion And even though I'm feeling good Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord Wandering in the chaos the battle has left We climb up the mountain of human flesh To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life A young figure sits still by a pool He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool He is you Social Security took care of this lad We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower A flower?

I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms Now I'm back again And babe, it's gonna work out fine Can't you feel our souls ignite? Shedding ever-changing colours In the darkness of the fading night Like the river joins the ocean As the germ in a seed grows  We have finally been freed to get back home There's an angel standing in the sun And he's crying with a loud voice ""This is the supper of the mighty one"" Lord of Lords, King of Kings Has returned to lead his children home To take them to the new Jerusalem",,,,

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea. They're swept away and nothing is what is seems, The feeling of belonging to your dreams. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The sense of magic, the beauty that's been When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.",,,,

I want to know who you are! I want to know who you are! Your achievements defy belief from the belly of the beast rising like yeast, My release from low self esteem Came when I saw you rapping on my tv screen. Float like a butterfly, That describes my walk to school after fight night I felt so cool cause I was at place too, Love myself born slippy Outta love for you, And I knew that someday people would love me too. None of that heckling about my black skin got through, I would walk bare foot through hell for you, It was how I felt back then I would still do for you, So accept these humble words of praise, And my gratitude for those glorious days And your victorious ways, Instilled in the young minds, Skill sublime yours to mine!

1731,"Well, I left Kentucky back in forty nine An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry 'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black. One day I devised myself a plan That should be the envy of most any man I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand. I'd get it one piece at a time And it wouldn't cost me a dime You'll know it's me when I come through your town I'm gonna ride around in style I'm gonna drive everybody wild 'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. So the very next day when I punched in With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends I left that day with a lunch box full of gears I've never considered myself a thief But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece Especially if I strung it out over several years. The first day I got me a fuel pump And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome The little things I could get in my big lunchbox Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home. Now, up to now my plan went all right 'Til we tried to put it all together one night And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. The transmission was a fifty three And the motor turned out to be a seventy three And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone. So we drilled it out so that it would fit And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit We had that engine runnin' just like a song Now the headlight' was another sight We had two on the left and one on the right But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on. The back end looked kinda funny too But we put it together and when we got through Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin About that time my wife walked out And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts But she opened the door and said ""Honey, take me for a spin."" So we drove up town just to get the tags And I headed her right on down main drag I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around But up there at the court house they didn't laugh 'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds. I got it one piece at a time And it wouldn't cost me a dime You'll know it's me when I come through your town I'm gonna ride around in style I'm gonna drive everybody wild 'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. Ugh! Yeah, RED RYDER This is the COTTON MOUTH In the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER You might say I went right up to the factory And picked it up, it's cheaper that way Ugh!, what model is it? Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56 '57, '58' 59' automobile It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67 '68, '69, '70 automobile.",,,,

I could be one of your kids, white America! little Eric looks just like this, White America! Erica loves my s***, I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get,  white America! I Could be one of your kids,  white America! little Eric looks just like this,  white America! Erica loves my s***, I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get So to the parents of America I am the derringer aimed at little Erica To attack her character The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress And piss on the lawns of the White House To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy F*** you Ms. Cheney F*** you tipper Gore F*** you with the freeness of speech this  Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have F*** you! Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you",,,,

Silent as a day can be, Far-off sounds of others on their chosen run As they do all those things they feel give life some meaning, Even if they're dull. It's time to stop this dreaming, must rejoin the real world As revealed by orange lights and a smoky atmosphere. The trees and I are shaken by the same wind but whereas The trees will lose their withered leaves, I just can't seem to let them loose. And they can't refresh me those hot winds of the south. Oh I feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place. Now the light is fading fast, Chances slip away, a time will come to pass When there'll be none, Then addicted to a perfumed poison, Betrayed by its aftertaste, Oh we shall lose the wonder and find nothing in return. Many are the substitutes but they're powerless on their own. Beware the fisherman who's casting out his line Into a dried up river bed, But don't try to tell him 'cos he won't believe you. Throw some bread to the ducks instead, it's easier that way. I feel like an alien, a stranger in an alien place. The trees and I are shaken by the same wind but whereas The trees will lose their withered leaves, I just can't seem to let them loose. And they can't refresh me those hot winds of the south.

2025,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern, was making a million Being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but every year she was sober Her sons heart simultaneously grew colder He started hanging out selling bags in the projects Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He build a reputation 'cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities at other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto breed capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew Starting fights over little shit, up on the block Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock Working overtime for making money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treating him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club But only a real thug can stab someone till they die Standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well guarded And they wanted to test him, before business started Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted So now he had a choice between going back to his life Or making money with made men, up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot They drove around the projects slow while it was raining Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he had broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned A broken jaw mumbled for God but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head I'm falling and I can't turn back I'm falling and I can't turn back Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter Cause he was starring into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully, than when they were raping her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted You have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted And you'll be one of Gods children and fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because the dance with the devil might last you forever","It's us, mind power Live life, mind power It's us, mind power Live life, mind power Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm Life is a tour, I sit and ride along Taking some notes and then I write the song I'm staring down the road my life has gone Is this where I belong? Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong? My mental state is fucking me up And I cried upon while asking you for some answers But we don't have that type of bond Now my desires gone with the way that I've been living lately If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout 'Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down Feeling so damn humiliated 'cause they looking at me like I'm hellbound What story should I tell now? I'll just expose the truth I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to you But who the fuck are You? You never showed the proof And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do? There's way too many different religions with vivid descriptions Begging all fucking men and women to listen I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted These ain't wicked decisions, I got different intentions I been itching to get it, I've been given assistance But the whole fucking system is twisted Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it I need an answer and humans can't provide it I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it? Where's the Holy Ghost at? How long it take Man to find it? My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it You gave me a bible and expect me not to analyze it I'm frustrated and you provoked it I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it I have a fucking brain, you should know it You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment It was a mission that I had to abort 'Cause humans be lying with such an inaccurate source It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course Next Jehovah's witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised Humans are fucking dumb, still thinkin' that Pac's alive I ain't trying to take your legacy and torch it down I'm just saying, I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth Just sheep always telling stories of older guys Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized Now I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist Show yourself and the boom is done Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you're the one I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun And all my old habits can hop onto of a roof to plunge I'll donate to a charity that could use the funds Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You I hate the fact that I have to believe You haven't been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve And I ain't seen no talking snake or rabbit from trees With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me I don't know if you do or don't exist, shit is driving me crazy Send your condolences, this is me reaching to you so don't forget If hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it I'mma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit My gut feeling says it's all fake, I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith This isn't a small phase, my perspective's all changed My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day And in my mind I make perfect sense If you aren't real then all my prayers aren't worth a cent That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is And I could just sit in the church and say fuck in the services Man what if Jesus was a facade? Then that would mean the government's God I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box Man everything is what if, why is it always what if Planet Earth what if, the universe what if My sacrifice what if, my afterlife what if Every fucking thing that deals with you is fucking suspect I'm fucking done, I'm fucking done This is my fucking life and I'm living it, I'm having fun If you really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed We are you, and you're us, stop playing games My life's all I got, and heaven is all in my brain And when I feel I am in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain Do as you please, and I'll just do me, I'm a human, I'll stay in my lane Ill mind It's us, mind power Live life, mind power It's us, mind power Live life, mind power",,,

2089,You're in my stars you know Don't need no crystal ball to tell me so Whispering in the air Hoping that my words find you somewhere Even when I close my eyes I'll never recreate the Time that flies The consequence is hanging there The sky will fall but I don't care Meet me beneath my balcony and say No one but you could ever fill my night Be the sunlight in my every day Underneath my balcony I'll say No one but you could ever fill my night Be the sunlight in my every day Your love is haunting me And all I want is more to set me free Whispering in the air Hoping that my words find you somewhere Do you hear me call your name I know we will never be the same The consequence is hanging there The sky will fall but I don't care Meet me beneath my balcony and say No one but you could ever fill my night Be the sunlight in my every day Underneath my balcony I'll say No one but you could ever fill my night Be the sunlight in my every day,,,,
2090,It's the first day Since I handed you your final rose In your house I'm staring out the window at our tree (We planted below) The heights of which You'll never Ever know You always Were there to rescue me From December In my minds eye I see you next to me as I'm on my knees It's in this place That you showed me how to ask eternity For shelter For comfort For relief I see our branches stretching To heights you'd not believe One day these leaves will reach you And there will be no more Pain You always gave me refuge Unconditional You always offered shelter From December's snow My chin still rests upon you While my feet they sway I wonder if you'll look the same When you embrace me On that day,,,,

I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face I wanna get better, better, better, better, I wanna get better I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change I wanna get better, better, better, better, I wanna get better Better, 'cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi I'm screaming from my bedroom window Even if its gonna kill me Woke up this morning early before my family From this dream where she was trying to show me How a life can move from the darkness She said to get better So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself Hey, I wanna get better! I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face I wanna get better, better, better, better, I wanna get better I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change I wanna get better, better, better, better, I wanna get better",,,,

When we were kids, we hated things our parents did We listened low to Casey Kasem's radio show That's when friends were nice, To think of them just makes you feel nice The smell of grass in spring And October leaves cover everything. Have you forgotten how to love yourself?  I can't believe all the good things that you do for me Sat back in a chair like a princess from a faraway place Nobody's nice, when you're older your heart turns to ice And shut out what they say; They're too dumb to mean it anyway When we were kids, we hated things our sisters did Backyard summer pools and Christmases were beautiful And the sentiment of coloured mirrored ornaments And the open drapes Look out on frozen farmhouse landscapes Have you forgotten how to love yourself?",,,,

2494,"There was no time for pain  No energy for anger  The sightlessness of hatred slips away  Walking through winter streets alone  He stops and takes a breath  With confidence and self-control  I look at the world and see no understanding  I'm waiting to find some sense of strength  I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart  To show me understanding  I need to live life  Like some people never will  So find me kindness  Find me beauty  Find me truth  When temptation brings me to my knees  And I lay here drained of strength  Show me kindness  Show me beauty  Show me truth  The way your heart sounds  Makes all the difference  It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel  The way your heart beats  Makes all the difference  In learning to live  Here before me is my soul  I'm learning to live  I won't give up till I've no more to give  No more to give  Listening to the city  Whispering its violence  I set out watching from above  The 90's bring new questions  New solutions to be found  I fell in love to be let down  Once again we dance in the crowd  At times a step away  From a common fear that's all spread out  It won't listen to what you say  Once you're touched you stand alone  To face the bitter fight  Once I reached for love  And now I reach for life  Another chance to lift my life  Free the sensation in my heart  To ride the wings of dreams  Into changing horizons  It brings inner peace within my mind  As I'm lifted from where I spilt my life  I hear an innocent voice  I hear kindness, beauty and truth  The way your heart sounds  Makes all the difference  It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel  The way your heart beats  Makes all the difference  In learning to live  Spread before you is your soul  So forever hold the dreams within our hearts  Through nature's inflexible grace  I'm learning to live",,,,
