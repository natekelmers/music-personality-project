This shirt cost $20"" I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!"" The next half hour was the same old thing My mother buying me clothes from 1963 And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips! I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep"" She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet"" I said, ""Mom, let's put these clothes back, please"" She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show"" I said, ""This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers But if you don't want to I can live with that but You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks"" She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same Inevitably the first day of school came I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it"" There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought And those who weren't laughing still had a ball Because they were pointing and whispering As I walked down the hall I got home and told my Mom how my day went She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the, ""Cause they're not good friends"" For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times So to you all the kids all across the land There's no need to argue Parents just don't understand Oh-kay, here's the situation ""parents"" 68 lines, 2662 characters.

I said, ""Yeah"" She said, ""Why?"" I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy"" She said, ""How do I know you're not sick? You could be some deranged lunatic"" I said, ""see'mon toots - my name is the Prince = Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""

They didn't speak I said, ""I want to plead my case"" But my father just shoved me in the car by my face That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived They took turns - One would beat me while the other one was driving I can't believe it, I just made a mistake Well parents are the same no matter time nor place So to you all the kids all across the land Take it form me Parents just don't understand",,,,,,,

And momma didn't like it And you and Laney were to young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gonna be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird Ima give you the world Ima buy a diamond ring for you Ima sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine Ima break that birdies neck I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't f*** with dad (ha)",,,,,,,

Who do you think you are? Just look at me now! Inside I'm lost Now I'm vain, numb this pain, why is it burning? Clean as rain, not a stain, so why am I yearning? I can't sleep, I twist and turn In too deep, I sweat, I burn I'm afraid that I'll awake, dressed up in a big mistake Then I'd break! What if I just closed my eyes?

Well he lives by that memory and falls from his mind And you know it's a lion's heart That will tumble and tear apart When he's coming down the hills for you Well he'll walk in the city forever Oh, walk in a time to be gone Well there's no real goodbye if you mean it So I guess I'm forever alone Now he's a stranger among us, he will die in the park Where he hides from the statues and the weather remarks In that land there's a winter In that winter's a day In that day there's a moment when it all goes away And you know it's a lion's heart That will tumble and tear apart When it's coming down the hills for you",,,,,,,

The lines we've crossed in search of change, but all they see is treason Although we have no obligation, to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive (Break out) I won't be left here Behind closed doors. Bonfires burn like beacons, Guiding the lost and weakened. Flames dance on crashing waves, Guiding ships who've gone a stray Time out, let's stop and think this through, We've all got better things to do, A talk in circles run in place, Answers inches from my face. Although we have no obligation, to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive (Break out) I won't be left here Behind closed doors. Black eyes, broken fingers, Blood drips and I let it run down my lips and to my swollen gums When hope is non-existent, Our instincts all scream, ""Run"", We never turn our backs or even bite our tongue. Although we have no obligation, to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive (Break out) I won't be left here Behind closed doors.

There's a point I think we're missin', It's in the air we raise our fists in, In the smiles we cast each other, My sister, my brother. About the time we gave up hope and We never find these locks still open, Stumbling on stones unturned, The hurt we feel, we all have found. The lines we've crossed in search of change, but all they see is treason Although we have no obligation, to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive (Break out) I won't be left here Behind closed doors. Bonfires burn like beacons, Guiding the lost and weakened. Flames dance on crashing waves, Guiding ships who've gone a stray Time out, let's stop and think this through, We've all got better things to do, A talk in circles run in place, Answers inches from my face. Although we have no obligation, to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive (Break out) I won't be left here Behind closed doors. Black eyes, broken fingers, Blood drips and I let it run down my lips and to my swollen gums When hope is non-existent, Our instincts all scream, ""Run"", We never turn our backs or even bite our tongue. Although we have no obligation, to stay alive On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive (Break out) I won't be left here Behind closed doors.

1452,"I wanted to be a typewriter mender when I grew up, But things didn't work out so. Sleep Late in the morning, climb up Mt. Olympia and replace a Return: But I didn't get enough good grades. My uncle Peter had the Parthenon Business Machine Remediation outfit, And right there, on the shop floor, Hundreds of electric-selectrics, all messed up: But I didn't get enough good grades. I had a dexadrine hyperactivity selective Attend to relevant Information tempo taken in told to Mechanism coping concept Put my head down crumple my paper. Sent to look at the future-job folder-binders, I got distracted by the graphs. In the resource room Mrs. Petorsky re-enforced me: Raisins from her zip-lock bag, And free time after my target behavior I was positive about: Tickets, tangibles, chips and stars. Now playing I'm In My Own Little House: Tickets, tangibles, chips and stars. I had a dexadrine hyperactivity selective Attend to relevant Information tempo taken in told to Mechanism coping concept Put my head down crumple my paper. After school I was sitting in the sitting room Looking out at the pavers in their bright orange vests Holding up the slow-go diamond plastic piece of wood, And I knew that I'd never be any good And never wear a hard-hat and do things like that, So I joined the police force: Damp in Dumbarton dip about the 14th of May. The publican dropped me a line thought there had been foul play: The farmer up the hill came in with his knife He mumbled something darkly about his young wife. Riding up on the postcoach I thrummed on my notebook. The wind was up, I held on my hat. I do up my coat, look: The farmer stumbled past holding his gun He mumbled something darkly about his young son. About your wife, sir. What about her? Pray, where is she? Nowhere you'll see. Locked him up in the store room of Mrs. McVeigh's Inn. Take tea up in the manor Sir Robert Grayson. The farmer through the window came in with his sword; He mumbled out of breath Forgive me m'lord. And after that rustic imposition I took a deposition I shared a Woodpecker cider with a local fratricider Who told me all this stuff and more: Well I rode up to Springfield on my motorcycle And I's gonna stay with my younger brother Michael. Mom's oxycontoins and the Amstel Light But I noticed I was doing most of the talking that night. So I got both remotes and turned off the DVD And said Michael is there something that you need to say to me? Well I don't know how to tell you. You can tell me any Thing that you want â??cept I started seeing Jenny: I started seeing Jenny. My Jenny? And he looked down at the floor. You know damn well she ain't your Jenny no more. And I said Get her on the phone. Don't you think it's a little late? No I don't think it's a little late. But I went out the room cause I knew I'd better wait So I went down to her dad's bakery and she said I'm gonna go outside take a break smoke a cigarette. I'm still surprised at how mad you get. Well what'd you expec'? That you wouldn't try to wreck your little brother's happiness. And I said Listen to you! I know what you're trying to do. And what whould that be? Mess with Michael's head as some kind of revenge back at me. So I drove up to Springfield in my wife's new car And went and had a drink at my buddy's old bar.",,,,,,,
