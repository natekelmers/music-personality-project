It's driven me before And it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around But lately I am beginning to find That when I drive myself my light is found So whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there with open arms and open eyes Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there, I'll be there Would you choose water over wine Hold the wheel and drive? Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there with open arms and open eyes Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there, I'll be there",,,,,,,,

I can't find mommy, where is she?"" ""I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself"" I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing ""You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"" ""Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"" She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it ""Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, ""This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"" I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em They're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late"" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' ""Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"" But baby we're in Sweden How did you get to Sweden?

Who's that rapping at my chamber door? Mr. (mister) Raven! All up in my grill like, ""Nevermore."" Kick it! Once upon a midnight dreary, while I kicked it weak and weary, Dark and cold just like Lake Eerie, Brand New sample, someone clear me. While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping. Up like, ""What?"", this thunder clapping in my brain like graphic Halflings. Staffing me, I put down Milton. Cell phone mute like Paris Hilton. Open window, halfway built-in. Times a changing like Bob Dylan. Twenty-pound bird black as could be, cold feet cold eyes aimed straight at me. Grim face, grim stare, death carnivore, quote that raven ""Nevermore."" Who's that (who's that) rapping? Who's that rapping at my chamber door? Mr. (mister) Raven! All up in my grill like, ""Nevermore."" I miss Lenore, my Annabel Lee, taken by angels from me. Alone with books (hey that's me!), harbinger of death visiting me. I said, ""Can I help you, evil prophet? If you got a problem, look, I'll solve it."" He checked my hook, DJ revolved it, perched on Pallas, chalice dropped it. ""Tell me sir, please, if you can. Am I good or evil man? What can I say, what can I do, when will I be rid of you?"" ""Nevermore, "" quote he at me, hating on this fresh MC, Satanic raven, Niche glee, killing me softly like the Fugees. Now I feel worse, my verse is terse, joy inverse just like Fred Durst. Call a nurse, disperse my thirst put this process in reverse. Wish I'd had some warning first, MC Lars, '88 hearse. Now I'll never be Slug or Murs, under that black raven's curse. The ravens eyes still have the seeming of a demon that is dreaming, Lamplight over him still streaming, hear my screaming, hear me screaming! My soul still floats there on that floor and shall be lifted nevermore. Afflicted calm, like Michael Moore, canonized piece, US folklore. Who's that (who's that) rapping? Who's that rapping at my chamber door? Mr. (mister) Raven! All up in my grill like, ""Nevermore."" Who's house? Raven's house!",,,,,,,,
