And momma didn't like it And you and Laney were to young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gonna be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird Ima give you the world Ima buy a diamond ring for you Ima sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine Ima break that birdies neck I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't f*** with dad (ha)",,,

Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep, It's killing me, I'm dying. To put a little sunshine in your life. Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me. Soleil all over you Warm sun. Now this slick fallen rift, Came like a gift, Your body moves ever nearer And your will dry this tear Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain, Then it's replaced, sun setting And suddenly we're in love with everything. Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me. Soleil all over you Warm sun.",,,

Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right.  She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white. I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a Zebra! I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way,  Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet. I ran, I jumped out the back window,  But her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4. Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right.  The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night. But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad, that's the best damn pussy I ever had. I got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine.  I'm a fuck that bitch just one more time. Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need. We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed. And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns,  Singing them dirty rap songs Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong,  Sell tapes from here to Hong Kong. So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems. Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale,  Skatin' on Dayton rims. So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville. If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my caddy will. I met this lady in Hollywood.  She had green hair, but damn she looked good. I took her to my house, cause she was fine,  But she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine. I met this lady from Japan, never made love with an African. I fucked her once, I fucked her twice.  I ate that pussy like shrimp fried rice. Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya.  I met a woman in the heart of Australia. Had a big butt and big titties, too,  So I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo. See, I met this lady from Hawaii.  Stuck it in her ass, and she said, ay! Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch,  Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch. Met Colonel Sander's wife in the state of Kentucky.  She said, I'll fry some chicken if you just fuck me. I came in her mouth.  It was a crisis.  I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices. Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need. We can go to the park after dark,  Smoke that tumbleweed. And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns,  Singing them dirty rap songs Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong,  Sell tapes from here to Hong Kong. Hey, wait a minute man, check this out. I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee.  Her titties were filled with Hennesy. That country music nearly drove me crazy,  But I rode that ass and said, Yes, Miss Daisy! Met this lady in Oklahoma Put that pussy in a coma. Met this lady in Michigan I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again. Met a real black girl in South Carolina,  Fucked her 'til she turned into a white albino. Fucked this hooker in Iowa.  I fucked her on credit, so I owe her. Fucked this girl, down in Georgia; came in her mouth.  Man, I thought I told ya. Met this beautiful sexy ho;  She just ran cross the border of Mexico. Fine young thing, said her name's Maria.  I wrapped her up just like a Hot Tortilla. I want to get married, but I can't afford it.  I know I'ma cry when she gets deported. Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need. We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed. And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns,  Singing them dirty rap songs Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong,  Sell tapes from here to Hong Kong. Have you ever went over to a girl's house to fuck,  But the pussy just ain't no good? (say what?) And then you're getting' upset cause you can't get her wet,  Plus you in the wrong neighborhood? So you try to play it off and eat the pussy,  But it takes her so long to cum (say what?) Then a dude walks in. That's her big boyfriend,  And he asks you where you from? (Where you from, man?) So you wipe your mouth, and you try to explain (I don't bang.),  You start talkin' real fast. But he's already mad, cause you fuckin' his wife,  So he starts beatin' on your ass. Now your clothes all muddy, your nose all bloody,  Your dick was hard but now it's soft. (what?) You thought you had a girl to rock your world,  Now you still gotta go jack off. Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need. We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.",,,

Oh can't we learn To feel what's right and what's wrong?

160,"Dawn of light lying between A silence and sold sources Chased amid fusions of wonder In moments hardly seen forgotten Colored in pastures of chance Dancing leaves cast spells of challenge Amused but real in thought We fled from the sea whole Dawn of thought transferred through moments Of days under searching earth Revealing corridors of time provoking memories Disjointed but with purpose Craving penetrations offer links With the self instructors sharp And tender love as we took to the air A picture of distance Dawn of our power we amuse Re descending as fast as misused Expression, as only to teach love as To reveal passion chasing Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean Dawn of love sent within us Colors of awakening among the many Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age As the links span our endless caresses For the freedom of life everlasting Talk to the sunlight caller Soft summer mover distance mine Called out a tune but I never saw the face Heard but not replaced I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day Lost in lights array, I ventured to see As the sound began to play What happened to this song we once knew so well? Signed promise for moments caught within the spell I must have waited all my life for this moment, moment The future poised with the splendor just begun The light we were as one And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun And for a moment when our world had filled the skies Magic turned our eyes To feast on the treasure set for our strange device What happened to wonders we once knew so well? Did we forget what happened surely we can tell We must have waited all our lives for this, moment, moment Moment Starlight, movement, reasons Release forward tallest rainbow Sun shower seasons, fife flower reasons They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe that I can feel it There's someone to tell you Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest Thoughts would send our fusion Clearly to be home Getting over wars we do not mean or so it seems so clearly Sheltered with our passion, clearly to be home They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe they really mean to There's someone, to tell you and I just can't Believe our song will leave you Skyline teacher, warland seeker Send out poison, cast iron leader And through the rhythm of moving slowly Sent through the rhythm work out the story Move over glory to sons of old fighters past Young Christians see it from the beginning Old people feel it, that's what they're saying Move over glory to sons of old fighters past They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe they really mean to There's someone, to tell you A course towards a universal season Getting over overhanging trees Let them rape the forest They might stand and leave them Clearly to be home Getting over wars we do not mean We charm the movement suffers Call out all our memories Clearly to be home We've moved fast We need love A part we offer is our only freedom What happened to this song we once knew so well? Signed promise for moments caught within the spell We must have waited all our lives for this moment, moment Past present movers, moments we'll process the future But only through him we know, send flowered rainbows A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights Of songs to follow and show all we feel for And know of cast round, you seekers of the truth Accepting that reason will relive and breath and hope And chase and love for you and you and you",,,

211,So much confusion When autumn comes around What to do about October How to smile behind a frown? It's hard to settle down It's so bemusing Will they cancel the parade? We marched each October Now they say we were never even saved We must be very brave Shall I rewrite or revise My October symphony? Or as an indication Change the dedication From revolution to revelation? So we're all drinking As leaves fall to the ground Because we've been thinking How October's let us down Then and now Shall we remember December instead? Or worry about February? Mourn our war-torn dead Never seeing red? Shall I rewrite or revise My October symphony? Or as an indication Change the dedication From revolution to revelation?,,,

The dark Lord rides in force tonight And time will tell us all. Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, Rest not to lock your homes. Side by side we wait the might Of the darkest of them all. I hear the horses' thunder Down in the valley blow, I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, Waiting for the eastern glow. The apples of the valley hold, The seas of happiness, The ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no. Oh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light. The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red. Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly. The sky is filled with good and bad That mortals never know. Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow, Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow. The pain of war cannot exceed The woe of aftermath, The drums will shake the castle wall, The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on. Sing as you raise your bow, Shoot straighter than before. No comfort has the fire at night That lights the face so cold. Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the mornin' light. The magic runes are writ in gold To bring the balance back, bring it back. At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by, With flames from the dragon of darkness The sunlight blinds his eyes.",,,

We all hurt a little sometimes, we're alright So mothers hold your children, don't you ever let 'em go There is weakness in your grip and they are holding all our hope Don't you ever let me go (Don't you ever let me go) Don't you ever let me go (Don't you ever let me go) Who left the door open Who left me outside I'm on my knees and I'm hoping That someone holds me tonight Hold me tonight Someone left the door open Who left me outside I'm bent, I'm not broken Come live in my life All the words left unspoken Are the pages I write On my knees and I'm hoping That someone holds me tonight Hold me tonight",,,

Altering trouble, you cannot fix Envy of others never makes me rich All my heroes, they're all dead I remain here inside my We have heard the chimes at midnight Into the void I go Will I ever see your face again Or will blank be all I know Arriving inside Ire hurts a life And the darkness here is grim But it found us, surrounded Lead me deep into the canyon You push your guidance in the wrong hands Feet ungrounded, giving your best Now take your gold into silence You take a stand, bracing yourself For this cold is never ending We have heard the chimes at midnight Into the void I go Will I ever see your face again Or will blank be all I know Arriving inside Ire hurts a life",,,

Hearing Hearing Hearing your wonderous stories. Hearing your wonderous stories. It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.

Or is it just a holy fairytale And God is dead? God is dead, God is dead God is dead, God is dead Right!

877,"From a dense forest of tall dark pinewood, Mount Ida rises like an island.  Within a hidden cave, nymphs had kept a child;  Hermaphroditus, son of gods, so afraid of their love.  As the dawn creeps up the sky  The hunter caught sight of a doe.  In desire for conquest,  He found himself within a glade he'd not beheld before.     Hermaphroditus:  ""Where are you, my father?  Give wisdom to your son""     Narrator:  Now lost, the boy was guided by the sun""  ""Then he could go no farther  And as his strength began to fail  He saw a shimmering lake.  A shadow in the dark green depths  Disturbed the strange tranquility.     Salmacis:  ""The waters are disturbed  Some creature has been stirred""      Narrator:  ""The waters are disturbed  Naiad queen Salmacis has been stirred""  As he rushed to quench his thirst,  A fountain spring appeared before him  And as his heated breath brushed through the cool mist,  A liquid voice called, ""Son of gods, drink from my spring"".  The water tasted strangely sweet.  Behind him the voice called again.  He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone  And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake.     Salmacis:  ""We shall be one  We shall be joined as one""     Narrator:  ""She wanted them as one  Yet he had no desire to be one""     Hermaphroditus:  ""Away from me cold-blooded woman  Your thirst is not mine""     Salmacis:  ""Nothing will cause us to part  Hear me, O Gods""  Unearthly calm descended from the sky  And then their flesh and bones were strangely merged  Forever to be joined as one.  The creature crawled into the lake.  A fading voice was heard:  ""And I beg, yes I beg that all who touch this spring  May share my fate""     Salmacis:  ""We are the one  We are the one""      Narrator:  ""The two are now made one  Demi-god and nymph are now made one""  Both had given everything they had.  A lover's dream had been fulfilled at last,  Forever still beneath the lake.",,,

1010,"Wealth is a sick man’s game. Those who have it and those who hunger for it. To the victor go the spoils of fame—those who seek it, and those who abhor it. Evil is a very real concept, boiling in the bellies of the graceful. Toiling in the fortress in their complex, to our employers we are faithful. A number arises and there’s a spark in the eye, obscuring the vision, clouding the mind. “I am the authority on who deserves what. To continue your prosperity, you’ve gotta pay a little cut. We’ll be ruthless and cutthroat and get what we deserve. We’ll remove each tooth from each swollen mouth and finger at the nerve.” When a hand makes a fist, sometimes knuckles crack and break. When that fist strikes the ground, the plates will shift, the Earth will shake. Knuckle bones now exposed—true intention, self serving goals. Bank accounts that tell of rape. The plates will shift, the Earth will shake. Evil is a very real concept, dancing in the diner to your upset. Sharing drinks and laughing through their teeth. Their only success is our defeat. So drape yourself in the finest velvets, cape, mask, and tights, and jump from the closest, tallest building and reach new heights. Revel in the adoration you acquire. Dive into the altruism you inspire. Then sit back and pour a drink, relax cause no one sees the other half. The same qualities that you despise are the qualities you personify. Dig deep and find your buried heart. I know it’s in there somewhere. Acquisition isn’t all there is, and no one’s too broken they can’t be repaired. Revisions of histories et al. abound. It flatters me now. It flatters me now… ”Hey spin that song back, it’s my favourite. It flatters me now.”",,,

1021,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue  Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true? I've been so far from here Far from your warm arms It's good to feel you again It's been a long long time Hasn't it?  I know a farmer who looks after the farm With water clear, he cares for all his harvest I know a fireman who looks after the fire You, can't you see he's fooled you all Yes, he's here again Can't you see he's fooled you all? Share his peace, sign the lease He's a supersonic scientist He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man Look, look into my mouth he cries And all the children lost down many paths I bet my life you'll walk inside  Hand in hand Gland in gland  With a spoonful of miracle He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary We will rock you, rock you little snake We will keep you snug and warm Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest We walked across the fields to see the children of the West But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground Waiting for battle The fight's begun, they've been released Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang Bang, bang, bang And they've given me a wonderful potion 'Cause I cannot contain my emotion And even though I'm feeling good Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord Wandering in the chaos the battle has left We climb up the mountain of human flesh To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life A young figure sits still by a pool He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool He is you Social Security took care of this lad We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower A flower?  If you go down to Willow Farm To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies Open your eyes, it's full of surprise Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks And the musical box Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad And everyone's happy to be here There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag The frog was a prince The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird  (Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail)  Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!)  Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese And wonderfully clean in the morning We've got everything, we're growing everything We've got some in, we've got some out  We've got some wild things floating about  Everyone, we're changing everyone You name them all, we've had them here And the real stars are still to appear (All change!)  Feel your body melt Mum to mud to mad to dad  Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office You're all full of ball Dad to dam to dumb to mum  Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing You're all full of ball Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes Ooh, aah, na-na-na  Momma I want you now And as you listen to my voice To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause You've been here all the time Like it or not, like what you got You're under the soil (the soil, the soil) Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!) So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang  And all of us fit in our places With the guards of Magog, swarming around The Pied Piper takes his children underground Dragons coming out of the sea Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me He brings down the fire from the skies You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes Better not compromise, it won't be easy 666 is no longer alone He's getting out the marrow in your backbone And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll Gonna blow right down inside your soul Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true? I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms Now I'm back again And babe, it's gonna work out fine Can't you feel our souls ignite? Shedding ever-changing colours In the darkness of the fading night Like the river joins the ocean As the germ in a seed grows  We have finally been freed to get back home There's an angel standing in the sun And he's crying with a loud voice ""This is the supper of the mighty one"" Lord of Lords, King of Kings Has returned to lead his children home To take them to the new Jerusalem",,,

For now, the lizard's shed it's tail  This is the end of man's long union with Earth.  From life alone to life as one,  Think not your journey's done  For though your ship be sturdy, no  Mercy has the sea,  Will you survive on the ocean of being?  Come ancient children hear what I say  This is my parting council for you on your way.  Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars  Where we have gone you know you never can go.  Watcher of the skies watcher of all  This is your fate alone, this fate is your own.",,,

In no time at all he took me to the gate. In haste I quickly checked the time. If I was late I had to leave to hear your wonderous stories. Had to hear your wonderous stories. Hearing Hearing Hearing your wonderous stories. Hearing your wonderous stories. It is no lie I can see deeply into the future.

Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread, The last sacred haunt of the dead. He learnt of the truth which only one wolf may know, The sceptre and crown of the king. Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack, Plunging through forests and snow-storm. Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky, Fang sped through the jungles of ice. Hard on his tale, One-eye drew from the pack An old hero conquered by none. Steep, for too steep grew the pathway ahead Descent was the only escape A wolf never flees in the face of his foe Fang knew the price he would pay One-eye stood before him With the crown upon his head Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow. Fang, son of great Fang, the Traitor we seek, The laws of the Brethren say this That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods And he, the Usurper must die  Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe But Fang fought the hero in vain Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red Never would the crown leave again One-eye hid the crown and with laurels on his head Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace.",,,

Finding pleasure from this house his ears, they did obey; In his life a moment's pleasure, never to delay. He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning; Seeing the things in diff'rent lights his life was redeemed. Words of peace will fill his mind and change his way of life; Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive. Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself; Asking not for pers'nal meaning, more for just himself. Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living; Take the things you need in life but remember the giving. Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out; Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt. Then you'll never worry as somtimes you used to do; Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, you.",,

Salmacis:  ""The waters are disturbed  Some creature has been stirred""      Narrator:  ""The waters are disturbed  Naiad queen Salmacis has been stirred""  As he rushed to quench his thirst,  A fountain spring appeared before him  And as his heated breath brushed through the cool mist,  A liquid voice called, ""Son of gods, drink from my spring"".  The water tasted strangely sweet.  Behind him the voice called again.  He turned and saw her, in a cloak of mist alone  And as he gazed, her eyes were filled with the darkness of the lake.     Salmacis:  ""We shall be one  We shall be joined as one""     Narrator:  ""She wanted them as one  Yet he had no desire to be one""     Hermaphroditus:  ""Away from me cold-blooded woman  Your thirst is not mine""     Salmacis:  ""Nothing will cause us to part  Hear me, O Gods""  Unearthly calm descended from the sky  And then their flesh and bones were strangely merged  Forever to be joined as one.  The creature crawled into the lake.  A fading voice was heard:  ""And I beg, yes I beg that all who touch this spring  May share my fate""     Salmacis:  ""We are the one  We are the one""      Narrator:  ""The two are now made one  Demi-god and nymph are now made one""  Both had given everything they had.  A lover's dream had been fulfilled at last,  Forever still beneath the lake.",,,

2000,"When I've been gone, when I'm right here, The minute my eyes open in the morning. Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway. Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming. My mind just can't escape you, The first time I touched you, that's when I knew. I want you trust me, I want you to love me, I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose. I want you to save me, I want you to crave me Even when I can't find my way to you. If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about, All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you. When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled, When your holding everything together for me. The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me. The way you know I'm holding something inside. Don't know what time has for us, But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of I want you trust me, I want you to love me, I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose. I want you to save me, I want you to crave me Even when I can't find my way to you. If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about, All it ever comes down to, is girl I just want you. Yeah, I just want you I want you trust me, I want you to love me, I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose. I want you to save me, I want you to crave me Even when I can't find my way to you. If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about, All it ever comes down to, is girl I just want you.

2007,"What do you think in the back seat? Traveling through the yellow open state Am I too slow to turn my thoughts to words To turn meaningless to meaning Am I too down to notice smell and sound To tell dull from bright Let the sad winter moon turn slow to my future And the cool dark air cover me in my nearing bed Where angels, men and mothers Get to spend their Sundays and holidays Where curtains hide the ugly scenes inside From the rest of us What's inside the brick walls of divide?

2008,"Dawn of light lying between A silence and sold sources Chased amid fusions of wonder In moments hardly seen forgotten Colored in pastures of chance Dancing leaves cast spells of challenge Amused but real in thought We fled from the sea whole Dawn of thought transferred through moments Of days under searching earth Revealing corridors of time provoking memories Disjointed but with purpose Craving penetrations offer links With the self instructors sharp And tender love as we took to the air A picture of distance Dawn of our power we amuse Re descending as fast as misused Expression, as only to teach love as To reveal passion chasing Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean Dawn of love sent within us Colors of awakening among the many Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age As the links span our endless caresses For the freedom of life everlasting Talk to the sunlight caller Soft summer mover distance mine Called out a tune but I never saw the face Heard but not replaced I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day Lost in lights array, I ventured to see As the sound began to play What happened to this song we once knew so well? Signed promise for moments caught within the spell I must have waited all my life for this moment, moment The future poised with the splendor just begun The light we were as one And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun And for a moment when our world had filled the skies Magic turned our eyes To feast on the treasure set for our strange device What happened to wonders we once knew so well? Did we forget what happened surely we can tell We must have waited all our lives for this, moment, moment Moment Starlight, movement, reasons Release forward tallest rainbow Sun shower seasons, fife flower reasons They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe that I can feel it There's someone to tell you Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest Thoughts would send our fusion Clearly to be home Getting over wars we do not mean or so it seems so clearly Sheltered with our passion, clearly to be home They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe they really mean to There's someone, to tell you and I just can't Believe our song will leave you Skyline teacher, warland seeker Send out poison, cast iron leader And through the rhythm of moving slowly Sent through the rhythm work out the story Move over glory to sons of old fighters past Young Christians see it from the beginning Old people feel it, that's what they're saying Move over glory to sons of old fighters past They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe they really mean to There's someone, to tell you A course towards a universal season Getting over overhanging trees Let them rape the forest They might stand and leave them Clearly to be home Getting over wars we do not mean We charm the movement suffers Call out all our memories Clearly to be home We've moved fast We need love A part we offer is our only freedom What happened to this song we once knew so well? Signed promise for moments caught within the spell We must have waited all our lives for this moment, moment Past present movers, moments we'll process the future But only through him we know, send flowered rainbows A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights Of songs to follow and show all we feel for And know of cast round, you seekers of the truth Accepting that reason will relive and breath and hope And chase and love for you and you and you",,,

Boats burn the bridge in the fens; The time of the past returns to my life And uses it. Don't blame me for the letters That may form in the sand; Don't look in my eyes, you may see all the numbers That stretch in my sky and color my hand. Don't say that I'm wrong in imagining That the voice of my life cannot sing. Fate enters and talks in old words: They amuse it. The hands shine darkly and white: Only in dark they appear. Bless the baby born today, Flying in pitch, flying on fear. They shine in my eyes and touch my face Where I have seen them placed before; Don't blame me, please, for the fate that falls: I did not choose it. I did not, no no, I did not I truly did not choose it.",,,

2125,"I spent a lot of my time looking at blue,  The color of my room and my mood:  Blue on the walls, blue out of my mouth;  The sort of blue between clouds, when the sun comes out,  The sort of blue in those eyes you get hung up about.  When that feeling of meaninglessness sets in,  Go blowing my mind on God:  The light in the dark, with the neon arms,  The meek He seeks, the beast He calms,  The head of the good soul department.  I see myself suddenly  On the piano, as a melody.  My terrible fear of dying  No longer plays with me,  for now I know that I&#039;m needed  For the symphony.  I associate love with red,  The colour of my heart when she&#039;s dead;  Red in my mind when the jealousy flies,  Red in my eyes from emotional ties,  Manipulation, the danger signs.  The more I think about sex, the better it gets.  Here we have a purpose in life:  Good for the blood circulation,  Good for releasing the tension,  The root of our reincarnations.  I see myself suddenly  On the piano, as a melody.  My terrible fear of dying  No longer plays with me,  for now I know that I&#039;m needed  For the symphony.

But I am only talking to myself 'cause she isn't there. My sister, I love my sister, she's the best. She's cooler than any other girl that I have ever met. She had the greatest band, she had the greatest guy. She's good at everything and doesn't even try. She's got a wall around her nobody can climb. She lets her ladder down for those who really shine. I tried to scale it, but to me she's blind. So I lit a firecracker, went off in my eye. I miss my sister, why'd she go ? She's the one who would have taken me To my first all-ages show. It was the violent femmes and the del fuegos, Before they had a record out.  Before they went gold, And started to grow. I miss my sister.  I miss my sister. I miss my sister.  I really miss her.",,,
