Tell them, 'God just dropped by to forgive our sins, And relieve us our doubt.",,,
178,"Show me how you do that trick The one that makes me scream he said The one that makes me laugh he said And threw his arms around my neck Show me how you do it And I promise you I promise that I'll run away with you I'll run away with you Spinning on that dizzy edge I kissed his face and kissed his head And dreamed of all the different ways I had To make him glow Why are you so far away? he said Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you That I'm in love with you You, soft and only You, lost and lonely You, strange as angels Dancing in the deepest oceans Twisting in the water You're just like a dream You're just like a dream Daylight licked me into shape I must have been asleep for days And moving lips to breathe his name I opened up my eyes And found myself alone alone Alone above a raging sea That stole the only boy I loved And drowned him deep inside of me You, soft and only You, lost and lonely You, just like heaven You, soft and only You, lost and lonely You, just like heaven",,,,

They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona And the skies always had little fluffy clouds And they moved down, they were long and clear And there were lots of stars at night And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful The most beautiful skies as a matter of fact The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire And the clouds would catch the colors everywhere That's neat, 'cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little You don't see that Layering different sounds on top of each other Layering different sounds on top of each other Little fluffy clouds and little fluffy clouds and Little fluffy clouds and little fluffy clouds and What were the skies like when you were young?

185,"No one likes looking at you  Your lack of ego offends male mentality  They need your innocence  To steal vacant love and to destroy  Your beauty and virginity used like toys  My mind is dead, everybody loves me  Wants a slice of me  Hopelessly passive and compatible  Need to belong, oh the roads are scarey  So hold me in your arms  I want to be your only possession Used, used, used by men  All they leave behind is money  Paper made out of broken twisted trees  Your pretty face offends  Because it's something real that I can't touch  Eyes, skin, bone, contour, language as a flower  No god reached me, faded films and loving books  Black and white TV  All the world does not exist for me  And if I'm starving, you can feed me lollipops  Your diet will crush me  My life just an old man's memory Little baby nothing  Loveless slavery, lips kissing empty  Dress your life in loathing  Breaking your mind with Barbie Doll futility  Little baby nothing  Sexually free, made-up to breakup  Assassinated beauty  Moths broken up, quenched at last  The vermin allowed a thought to pass them by  You are pure, you are snow  We are the useless sluts that they mould  Rock 'n' roll is our epiphany  Culture, alienation, boredom and despair  You are pure, you are snow  We are the useless sluts that they mould  Rock 'n' roll is our epiphany  Culture, alienation, boredom and despair",,,,
